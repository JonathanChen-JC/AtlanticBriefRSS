# Wayne Gretzky, Former Canadian Hero


作者:  | 发布时间: April 6, 2025, 2:15 PM ET


His countrymen aren’t mourning the loss of his scoring record.

In the summer of 1988, when I was 14 years old, I went camping with my family not far outside Toronto. We emerged from the woods and I wandered over to a newspaper box by the side of the road. Through its cracked glass, I saw a front-page picture of Wayne Gretzky, weeping. He’d been traded from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings. I followed my idol’s lead and burst into tears.

Gretzky, back then at least, was more than a hockey player to Canadians. He was homegrown royalty, a player of such quality, of such rare possibility, that he transcended the game we’ve always used to define ourselves. I wasn’t even a true hockey kid, but I had Gretzky’s signature Titan stick, white with red lettering, and a pennant on my bedroom wall that memorialized his 1981–82 season, when he pocketed 92 goals and 120 assists for 212 points, all records. He went on to better that assists mark five times and reset his own points record with 215 in 1985–86. No one else has recorded more than 200 points in a season; he did four times, one for each Stanley Cup that he won. He retired in 1999 with 61 records, including the record for most records, and he still has more assists than anyone else has managed points. He changed hockey math, and with it our country’s measure of itself.

Today Gretzky surrendered one of his most cherished records—the most goals in an NHL career—to Alex Ovechkin, a 39-year-old Russian who plays for the Washington Capitals. Ovechkin scored his 895th goal, one better than Gretzky’s 894, in the second period against the Islanders in New York. He belly flopped onto the ice in ecstasy and relief before he was mobbed by his teammates, and then the game stopped to celebrate the greatest goal scorer who ever lived.

Gretzky, 64 years old and red-faced, was there to witness the occasion, the way Gordie Howe had encouraged Gretzky’s pursuit of his career-goals record. For more than a century, Canadians had taken turns eclipsing one another, a chain of succession that began with Joe Malone and included Howie Morenz and Maurice Richard, until Ovechkin overtook them all, claiming what Spencer Carbery, the Canadian-born coach of the Capitals, called “the greatest record in our sport.”

After Gretzky was traded to the Kings, his departure was cast as a mid-level national tragedy. “The biggest name in Canadian sports, the man hockey fans call the Great One, is going to the United States,” CBC anchor Knowlton Nash announced with a solemnity usually reserved for the deaths of princesses and declarations of war.

Not long ago, Canadians might have regarded the loss of Gretzky’s record with similar distress. Today they’re reacting with ambivalence. Some percentage of Canadians, including recent waves of Ukrainian refugees, will feel uneasy about the record belonging to Ovechkin, a vocal supporter of Vladimir Putin. But for many, the record had already slipped away—if not in 1988 then in 2025, when Donald Trump became the U.S. president again and Gretzky was there to cheer him on too.

Trump soon enraged Canadians with his “51st state” and “Governor Justin Trudeau” garbage, his trade war, and his open desire to annex our country. Anthem singers started getting earfuls at hockey games. Gretzky, who appears to have spent more time at Mar-a-Lago than in Canada lately, stayed a little too quiet about everything. When Canada and the U.S met in the final of the 4 Nations Face-Off in February, Gretzky was named our honorary captain and seemed reluctant to do it, without so much as a maple-leaf pin on his jacket lapel. After Canada won in overtime—I haven’t yelled at my TV like that in years—Gretzky gave the players red caps that said Be Great, a Trumpian echo that was either intentional or tone-deaf. He ended that debate on Friday night when he watched Ovechkin’s chase alongside Kash Patel, Trump’s FBI director. They sat together again this afternoon.

By then, Canadians were already calling Gretzky the “Great Once.” Someone smeared literal shit on his statue outside Edmonton’s Rogers Place; petitions were launched to rename the city’s Wayne Gretzky Drive and a parkway and arena in his hometown of Brantford, Ontario. Janet Gretzky, his American wife, came to his defense on Instagram: “I have never met anyone who is more Proud to be a Canadian, and it has broken his heart to read and see the mean comments,” she wrote. She deleted the post after other proud Canadians disputed her assessment.

Back in 1988, many of us in Canada blamed her for Gretzky’s exit. They had married weeks before the trade, a few months after her star turn in Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach. Los Angeles must have been her idea, we assumed, a misogynist trope that survived even after it became obvious that Gretzky’s exile was self-imposed. We erected statues in his honor and named roads and arenas after him anyway. He went to St. Louis, to New York, to Phoenix, and somehow remained claimed by us. In 2009, we named him a Companion of the Order of Canada, our highest civilian honor, and ignored that he didn’t bother coming home to pick up his medal.

Now it’s time for hard truths. Gretzky has lived in the U.S. longer than he lived up here, in an American mansion with an American wife and American kids, palling around on American golf courses with an American president who says that Canada “only works as a state.” It might break Gretzky’s heart to hear it, but a lot of Canadians don’t think of him as one of us anymore. Once, we cried over where he played his hockey. His face could have been on our money, never mind his name on our sticks. But he’s made clear his choice, and so we’ve made ours. Wayne Gretzky’s records, like his faults, are singular. The loss is his and his alone.

# Jack Black Knew Best


作者:  | 发布时间: April 6, 2025, 12:20 PM ET


The veteran performer understood how to engage the live audience on SNL—to often-hilarious effect.

For a show that prides itself on being, well, live, Saturday Night Live doesn’t usually thrive on engaging its in-studio audience. The machine of the long-running program doesn’t lend itself to spontaneity; any participation from the crowd is typically scripted.

But last night’s episode had a shaggier, looser vibe. Credit that to the host, Jack Black, and, in a surprise twist, last week’s musical guest, Morgan Wallen.

Wallen wasn’t actually present; the country musician created headlines last week when he bucked the tradition of sharing pleasantries during the goodbyes at the end of the night and abruptly walked off-stage straight to camera. The move was perceived as rude to the cast. Shortly thereafter, he posted a photo of his private jet to Instagram with the caption, “Get me to God’s country,” a seeming culture-war taunt that quickly became a meme.

In last night’s cold open, the SNL cast member James Austin Johnson, the show’s resident Donald Trump impressionist, responded to the dig. In character as the president, Johnson launched into a wandering monologue about Trump’s wide-reaching tariffs, which included targets such as the unpopulated McDonald Islands. SNL’s Trump envisioned the islands as a paradise inhabited by anthropomorphic Chicken McNuggets and a large, hula-skirt-wearing burger—a riff on the president’s well-documented love of McDonald’s. Holding up a poster of this fantasy, Johnson tossed off: “Get me to God’s country, right?”

The crowd roared knowingly, bursting in applause. “Remember that?” Johnson said, egging them on, as though the reference to Wallen was an inside joke shared by everyone there. The gag almost gave permission for the assembled group to get a little rowdier than usual.

Black’s monologue took up that challenge. The comic actor, who has maintained his goofy, rock-and-roll-loving persona his entire career, erupted into a guitar anthem about his return to hosting after a 20-year absence. He climbed stairs into a portion of the audience we don’t usually see, the group perched high above the set. He sat on a man’s lap, singing directly into his face “I bet this guy did not know he’d be on TV.” The man looked sheepishly at the camera as if to confirm that fact.

As Black traveled farther into the seats, he brought out a marching band to the delight of the guests, who started clapping along to the tune. Kieran Culkin and Bill Burr, co-stars in a new Broadway production of Glengarry Glen Ross, looked particularly charmed. They were apparently just there to enjoy the evening and suddenly ended up on-screen as if they were attending a sporting event.

Black’s participatory energy extended to his sketch work too. In “One Uppers,” Black joined cast members for a bit about college friends trying to impress one another with their respective virtue. Every time someone would brag about, say, giving up social media, thrifting a sweater, or going to a protest, the performer would break the fourth wall, turning to the camera with an overwrought pious expression, implicating viewers in the competition.

By the time “Weekend Update” came around, the audience seemed primed for some spontaneity. In a guest segment about the White House Correspondents’ Association’s cancellation of the comedian Amber Ruffin’s hosting stint at their annual dinner, Ego Nwodim commented on how she would handle the job. Instead of roasting politicians, she told the “Update” anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che, she would make fun of the food. As she strutted in front of the desk taking on the persona of “Miss Eggy,” she let loose with a series of intentionally hacky jokes and the swag of a Def Comedy Jam appearance. The audience was eager to play along—so eager that it actually yelled out replies when she started a call-and-response as part of her routine.

When she riffed on Cory Booker’s 25-hour-long filibuster, saying she’d had her “fill of bustas,” she proclaimed, “because these men ain’t what?” The crowd yelled “Shit!” before the word could get bleeped out. Nwodim was clearly surprised but also seemed a little thrilled, merrily noting that the show was going to get fined as Jost and Che howled with laughter behind her. It was a classic moment of live television—one that unexpectedly brought the performers and the audience just a little bit closer to each other.

## The Cabinet Secretary Who Wants His Cookies Freshly Baked

# The Cabinet Secretary Who Wants His Cookies Freshly Baked


作者:  | 发布时间: April 6, 2025, 11:07 AM ET


The unusual requests made of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s staff are raising concerns all the way to the White House.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum likes chocolate-chip cookies—preferably freshly baked and still warm.

This peculiar fact became the talk of the Department of Interior in recent weeks after his chief of staff, JoDee Hanson, made an unusual request of the political appointees in his office: Learn to regularly bake cookies for Burgum and his guests, using the industrial ovens at the department headquarters.

That request was not the only move by his team that has alarmed some Interior officials. Four people familiar with Burgum’s leadership, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told The Atlantic that Burgum was focused on his status as the leader of a minor cabinet department and that those who ran his office repeatedly made unusual demands to his employees. His office leadership once instructed political appointees to act as servers for a multicourse meal. They also dispatched a U.S. Park Police helicopter for his personal transportation. On at least one occasion, a political appointee was told to remake the cookies because the batch was subpar, according to three people.

Some of the concerns have been elevated to senior White House officials, according to the sources. One person familiar with the behavior described Burgum as “Doug the diva.” Three people said the concerns have been widely discussed among lower-level staff at the Department of Interior. Two people said political appointees in Burgum’s office have been seen crying because of the demands placed on them.

“These pathetic smears are from unnamed cowards who don’t know Doug Burgum and are trying to stop President Trump’s Energy Dominance agenda,” Interior spokesperson Katie Martin told us in a statement. “Everyone knows Secretary Burgum always leads with gratitude and is humbly working with President Trump.”

Two Interior Department officials, speaking anonymously to push back on what they say are false claims, said the cookies—which are made from store-bought, premade dough and served to guests and staff in a basket—are simply part of the hospitality the department offers to visitors. The helicopter trip, they said, was arranged by his security detail. One of these officials also pointed out that most of these complaints are from the early days of the administration, when the office was still ramping up and few political appointees were on staff.

“He’s not demanding cookies, he’s not demanding a helicopter,” an Interior Department official told us in response. “It is antithetical to diva behavior.”

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly similarly dismissed any concern when asked for a comment on this story. “Only The Atlantic could spin baking warm cookies for guests as a bad thing. Cold-hearted people!” she wrote to us in a statement. “Secretary Burgum is doing an outstanding job leading the Department of Interior.”

Burgum is not the first Trump Cabinet secretary to spark controversy inside a federal department for the way the secretary’s office is run. During Trump’s first term, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in 2018 amid at least a dozen federal investigations that included claims that he was overspending on travel and tasking federal workers to do personal work. Former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was investigated after emails surfaced showing a federal worker had been tasked with sending Christmas ornaments to her family. And congressional Republicans investigated reports that former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke planned to spend $139,000 on replacement doors for his office. He later testified that the final cost was $75,000, and that the high price was required because of the historic nature of the building.

Before entering politics, Burgum was a successful businessman, amassing a net worth above $100 million. The former North Dakota governor nearly got the nod last summer to be Trump’s running mate, ending up on Trump’s list of three finalists. When Trump won, he was hoping for a high-profile role, such as secretary of state. Trump appointed Burgum instead to Interior, also naming him to the National Security Council at the White House and to be chair of the newly formed National Energy Dominance Council.

Larger cabinet agencies typically come with more perks for senior officials, like multiple food-service options and government aircraft for official travel. That is not the case at the Department of the Interior, which manages the National Park Service and about one-fifth of America’s land, as well as the federal government’s relationship with Indian tribes. The only restaurant at the C Street headquarters, Bison Bistro, closed during the coronavirus pandemic and has not reopened. Burgum’s Democratic predecessor, Deb Haaland, was known to periodically walk across the street to the Met Cafe for its buffet lunch.

Shortly after his confirmation, Burgum had breakfast with Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the Treasury headquarters next to the White House, according to three people briefed on the events. Treasury has a dedicated wait staff that can serve multicourse meals for the secretary and his guests in a private room, according to a former Treasury official. One departmental dining space, known as the “small conference room,” displays the silverware of Alexander Hamilton, the nation’s first Treasury secretary.

Days after the breakfast, on February 11, Burgum’s office instructed four political appointees in the Office of the Secretary, who have no formal role in food service, to stage a similar, multicourse lunch for a meeting with Wright and Mark Christie, the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. His office ordered catered food, and the political appointees plated it into multiple serving courses and washed the dishes afterward. Concerns about the use of political appointees—who are supposed to be helping to run the department—to serve food to the secretary later reached the White House, two people said.

The two Interior Department officials said that because the department has no cafeteria, staff will help serve food if Burgum has guests over. Burgum’s meal with Wright and Christie was not elaborate, they said—salad, lasagna, and dessert. “We’re talking three plates, three forks,” one of the officials said, adding that it was the only time Burgum hosted lunch at the department.

On February 7, Burgum’s office ordered Eagle One, a U.S. Park Police helicopter stationed in Anacostia Park, to land at polo fields near the National Mall to transport him to Andrews Air Force Base, where he was scheduled to meet President Trump and fly on Air Force One to Florida for the weekend. The eight-minute helicopter flight from Washington to Andrews is a standard privilege for presidents, who have their own helicopter fleet maintained by the U.S. Marines. Interior secretaries typically endure the 30- to 40-minute drive to Andrews.

The Aviation Unit of the U.S. Park Police, a division of the Department of Interior, does not routinely handle VIP transport, according to a U.S. Park Police fact sheet. The blue-and-white helicopters launch to provide additional aerial surveillance during presidential and other dignitary movements, and are used for “medevac, search and rescue, high-risk prisoner transport,” and to support for law-enforcement operations.

Interior travel guidelines state that “oﬃcial travel to give speeches, attend conferences or meetings, or make routine site visits” is not an acceptable justification for “mission requirement” travel in government aircraft. There is a separate category of “required use travel” that allows officials to use government aircraft for “certain specific communications, security and exceptional scheduling requirements.” Separate federal regulations require written permission from a senior legal officer for such travel.

A person briefed on Burgum’s use of the Park Police helicopter said the aircraft was requested by the secretary’s security team after concerns were raised that he might not make the Air Force One departure time after a meeting at the White House. Burgum had nothing to do with the decision to use the helicopter, that person said.

“The Secretary was slated to staff the President of the United States for a trip over the Gulf of America,” Martin told us in a statement. “When it was clear that afternoon D.C. traffic would not allow him to travel by vehicle, the decision was made to take a helicopter to ensure he arrived at Andrews on time to staff President Trump, which is a core mission of the Secretary of the Interior.”

Burgum, the two Interior Department officials added, regularly flies coach. Last Thursday, for instance, he flew on American Airlines to a fracking event in Washington County, Pennsylvania, in coach—the sort of commercial travel that is more typical, both said.

White House pool reports on February 7 described Trump arriving at 3:47 p.m. at Andrews and departing on Air Force One with Burgum on board shortly afterward. FlightAware, a company that tracks aviation movement, has no record of U.S. Park Police helicopters traveling in the Washington area on that day. But CopterSpotter, a website for the public to upload photos of helicopters they see in the Washington area, has a photograph of one of the Park Police helicopters flying near the Washington Monument at 3 p.m., shortly before Trump left the White House in his own helicopter.

Andrew Logan, an audio engineer who runs CopterSpotter and the website Helicopters of D.C., said that federal helicopters have the ability to turn off their outgoing GPS transponders, which might explain why FlightAware did not record the February 7 flight. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the Republican chair of the Commerce Committee, has been pushing federal aircraft in the D.C. region to more frequently display their transponder location after a January 29 crash between an Army helicopter not operating its transponder and a regional jet killed 67 people at Reagan National Airport.

Hanson, Burgum’s chief of staff, has told federal workers in Burgum’s office that the tradition of staff baking cookies began when he was governor of North Dakota, according to two people. She has worked for Burgum for decades, starting at his former company, Great Plains Software, before moving up to become a senior adviser to his gubernatorial campaign and the chief administrative officer for the state of North Dakota, according to her LinkedIn profile.

Burgum has also used the political appointees in his department for another purpose in recent days: stacking firewood in his office’s fireplace. At times, he has instructed his staff on the finer points of arranging logs so they won’t collapse and create noise when burning during meetings. An Interior Department official said many people in the department—from Burgum himself to the most junior staff—have helped make fires, and that if Burgum ever offered tips, it was not intended imperiously. Burgum, who worked as a chimney sweep in college, was likely just trying to be helpful, the official said.

Burgum has made some other peculiar requests of his staff. One standing request, described by two people, is that the labels get removed from water bottles before they are delivered to him. An Interior Department official said they remove the labels to avoid branding issues, especially when sharing photos on social media.

Not everyone who has worked for Burgum is concerned about the way he treats his staff. When an adviser close to Burgum over the past several years became aware of this story on Saturday evening, he proactively called us to say that, in the many hours he’s spent with Burgum, he has never seen him behave in an arrogant way. Burgum, this person told us, always carries his own bag and often replaces I in speeches with we in order to emphasize his team.

He so frequently begins meetings by expressing his gratitude for his staff or other people in the room that it’s become a running joke among his aides.

Burgum, this adviser said, is “the ultimate team guy who has a history of promoting young people,” dating back to his time at Great Plains Software.

# A Hilarious Movie That Understands the South

Culture and entertainment musts from Annie Joy Williams

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily’s Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what’s keeping them entertained. Today’s special guest is Annie Joy Williams, an assistant editor who has written about the end of Hooters and the Republican leaders who once thought January 6 was “tragic.”

Annie Joy enjoys listening to Michael Martin Murphey with her father, recommends watching Vengeance for some proper honey-butter-chicken-biscuit appreciation, and is a proud Alex Cooper apologist.

But first, here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:

- Trump’s tariffs are designed to backfire.
- The curse of Ayn Rand’s heir
- Ashley Parker on miscarriage and motherhood

The Culture Survey: Annie Joy Williams

A musical artist who means a lot to me: Michael Martin Murphey. I have to thank my father for introducing me to him. My father was a pilot, so he was constantly traveling when I was growing up outside of Nashville. When he was in town, it was a special treat for me and my sisters to get picked up in his GMC truck, which was equipped with crank windows and decorated with enough bumper stickers to cause some serious fights with my mom.

There was always a Michael Martin Murphey tape in the cassette player. His song “Wildfire” brought my dad to tears. My personal favorites were “Vanishing Breed” and “Children of the Wild World.” When he played “Pilgrims on the Way,” my dad would slap his Wrangler jeans in time with the lyric “The cowboy slaps the dust away.” Some combination of hay, dirt, and dust would fly into the air (he moonlighted as a farmer), and I thought it was hilarious. He and I went on a trip to Montana this past winter, and Murphey was once again our soundtrack, for the first time in about 15 years. We both cried as we looked out the window.

My favorite movies: La La Land, Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, and (500) Days of Summer are all top films for me. A less widely known film that I just adore is B. J. Novak’s Vengeance. I find that many films about the South are offensive to those of us who hail from there. And I get it, it’s easy to make southerners the butt of the joke—we really tee it up for people sometimes. Rarely do I find a film that adequately captures both the good and the bad of a place so storied and complex. Novak spent substantial time in West Texas before filming to better understand its people. “I want this to be Texans’ favorite movie,” he told Texas Monthly.

The film is hilarious. I saw it in D.C. with a group of friends I once lived with in Texas, and we kept saying how its portrayal of the North-South disconnect is spot-on. Plus, it pays proper homage to the honey-butter chicken biscuit, which I appreciate. [Related: The podcast spreading the love of cowboy culture]

The last museum or gallery show that I loved: The Alvin Ailey exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American Art, in New York City. As a dance teacher, I’ve always admired the contributions Ailey made to modern dance. He was a gay Black man from rural Texas who used choreography as a form of protest during the civil-rights movement. He eventually became a household name in New York, showcasing routines inspired by the river baptisms and gospel music of his Texas childhood. My favorite part of the exhibit was the collection of notes he wrote to himself, a mix of manifestos and eight-count choreography. I visited the exhibit with my mother, who sacrificed a lot to put me through dance classes and endless competitions, so experiencing that together was sweet.

A quiet song that I love, and a loud song that I love: I’m more of a quiet-song person myself, so I’ll give you three: “Boyhood,” by the Japanese House; “Bathroom Light,” by Mt. Joy; and “Into the Mystic,” by Van Morrison.

A loud song that I love is “Love It if We Made It,” by the 1975. Also, “Yoü and I,” by Lady Gaga. Makes me wish I was from Nebraska.

A cultural product I loved as a teenager and still love, and something I loved but now dislike: It wasn’t so much a cultural product as it was a cultural moment, but I’d like to think I grew up in the era of peak Disney Channel. My sisters are firmly Millennials, so I got to bear witness to the greats of their generation, such as Lizzie McGuire and Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, as well as those of my generation—Hannah Montana, The Cheetah Girls, and, perhaps most notably, Disney Channel Games. I might have been too cool to love this stuff by my teenage years, but I’ve recently returned to these classics. My best friend and I discovered a Disney Channel Original Hits dance class at a studio in Brooklyn. We’ve gotten really close with the instructor, and it’s quickly become the highlight of our week. Now, the concealer lips, ultra-thin eyebrows, and extreme side parts from that era? We can leave those in 2005. [Related: What tween TV teaches kids]

A favorite story I’ve read in The Atlantic: “Jenisha From Kentucky,” by Jenisha Watts, and “The Day I Got Old,” by Caitlin Flanagan.

An online creator whom I’m a fan of: Look, say what you will, but Alex Cooper is a mastermind. I used to be a skeptic. The first time I listened to Call Her Daddy, I was stunned. It was 2019, and she was still tag-teaming the podcast with Sofia Franklyn. The episode was truly one of the most vulgar things I’d ever heard. Now I know she was scheming from the start. Cooper grabbed the world’s attention through her sex-forward crassness, and right when the public was ready to cast her out as a buxom blonde with little more to her than sex tricks and a pretty face, she showed her smarts. In the new, sans-Franklyn version of her show, she often gets rare sit-downs with pop-culture phenomenons, political candidates, and renowned actors. And they actually share revealing things with her because they’re thinking: This girl was just detailing her sex life in front of the whole world—she can’t judge me. Her unconventional openness invites openness from anyone sitting across from her. Not every interview is groundbreaking, but at least she’s getting every interview. Is her approach my style? Maybe not, but I’m a proud Alex Cooper apologist.

A poem that I return to: I’d like to think that I’m above bias here, but my sister is a poet, and I have spent my life trying to be half the writer she is. I always come back to this one poem she wrote about our experience as girls in church. Now we watch our nieces grow up and discover God.

God was not a girl. The earth he made with apples seeds, the heavens with half-priced glitter.

We danced, and God smiled.

Drop the crayon,                                         take a tampon.

Sundays are for silver crosses and I’m sorry, prayer groups circling

rumors. God is purity vow and camp deposit. God is a one-piece swimsuit.

God is not a girl. Our hips he made with hunger, our tongues with minty silence.

We kneel, and God tells us to smile.

Why You Should Work Like It’s the ’90s

One Friday afternoon 10 years ago, Andrew Heaton, then a cable-news writer, joined his colleagues for a meeting. The show’s producer asked the staff to keep an eye on their email over the weekend in case they needed to cover a breaking news event. No one seemed to mind—working full days in person while remaining on call in the evening and on weekends has always been a standard practice in the news business—but Heaton had a simple request. He said he would be happy to go in but asked if his boss could call him on the phone instead of emailing him. He didn’t want to spend his time off continually monitoring his inbox for a message that might not even come … Heaton was onto something.

# What a Microscopic Creature Taught Me About Parenting


作者:  | 发布时间: April 6, 2025, 8 AM ET


A single-celled organism helped shift my perspective on climate change—and on my child’s future.

One evening earlier this year, I came downstairs after putting our 4-year-old daughter to bed to find my husband looking at a series of maps of the United States, each showing possible futures given different climate-change projections. In one, my home states of Oklahoma and Nebraska succumb to intense heat; growing crops gets harder. In another, wildfires seem to consume the West. In the Northeast, sea levels rise. Everywhere, average temperatures skyrocket. In Vermont, where I now live, the maps imply that we will still have precious rainfall—and that catastrophic floods will continue.

“Want to watch Netflix?” I said.

It’s not that I don’t care about these predictions of doom. But I admit that my initial response—as the United States has (again) moved to exit the Paris climate agreement, as the protections of the Endangered Species Act are threatened, as the way is cleared for drilling in the Arctic—is to succumb to the temptation of apathy. It’s all too much, I think. I find myself bewildered over how best to respond to these crises—and how to reconcile our daughter, peacefully asleep upstairs, with a burning world that is widely expected to keep burning.

My day-to-day parenting to-do list often goes something like: clean up endlessly after an enthusiastic tornado of a child; work toward a condition that, sometimes, resembles financial security; raise my child to be a decent adult; brace myself for the overwhelm that comes with the pressure I feel to help save a planet in the grips of the sixth extinction.

In my climate-related dread, I know I’m not alone—even though the surgeon general’s report last year about the extreme anxiety coloring the experience of growing numbers of U.S. parents doesn’t mention climate change in the list of concerns causing rampant stress, guilt, and shame among caregivers. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are worried about climate change and feel a personal responsibility to do something about it. Yet when I speak with my climate-conscious friends, family, and fellow mothers, everyone seems to be straining to find agency and purpose.

Read: The concession to climate change I will not make

Raising young children tethers people firmly to the now—to a sometimes joyful, sometimes harrowing, often mundane and narrow world. (As Bluey’s dad laments while carrying a laundry basket in one episode of the eponymous TV show: “This never ends!”) But global climate change tugs many parents’ attention and energy outward—to frightening events and uncertain futures, both of which can feel paralyzing.

I can read scientific papers and the latest United Nations climate reports; I can watch Los Angeles burn. But how do I understand what I’m supposed to do, with my hands?

Lately, to answer that question, I’ve been turning to tiny worlds for help.

I received a microscope for Christmas, and I’ve been disappearing into the preset slides it came with: onion skin (staggered oblong blocks with a dark dot, a nucleus, held in each); a smear of human blood (thousands of scattered discs); a splice of rabbit spinal cord (a spongy oval, misshapen beads around its perimeter). Here, among these orderly universes mere millimeters wide, I find I can breathe.

My husband gave me the microscope, aware of my growing obsession with the small—an interest sparked by my introduction to foraminifera (forams for short), single-celled organisms of an ancient order of protist, which number in the thousands of species. These organisms have inhabited marine ecosystems for more than 540 million years, surviving numerous mass-extinction events.

I first learned about forams when I was researching sea-level rise in Maine’s salt marshes. Forams inhabit almost all marine environments, from deepest water to shore. Perhaps the first record of them in the human canon dates to the fifth century B.C.E., in Herodotus’s Histories, when he makes note of shell-like fossils embedded in the limestone blocks of the Egyptian pyramids.

As their longevity indicates, forams are incredibly adaptable and resilient. They build their shells, called “tests,” around themselves, some by collecting minerals from the surrounding waters and cementing them together. The shelters, most of them between half a millimeter and one millimeter long, are single- or multichambered, and shaped like a tube or a sphere, a spiral or a whorl. If you search for an image of a foram, you might see one that looks like a rudimentary shell with a series of ethereal lines shining around it like the sun’s corona. These are pseudopodia, or rhizopodia (rhizo meaning “root”), and are made up of cytoplasm; forams extend and retract these cytoplasmic threads as needed for moving, feeding, and constructing their shells.

Do I digress?

For me, forams were not a digression, but a revelation. Because, listen: Many species of foram are highly site-specific; they evolved within a narrow set of conditions, such as the temperature and oxygen content of the water and the mineral makeup of the surrounding sediments. These site conditions are not preferences but nonnegotiable bounds of survival. The more closely I looked at forams, the more I realized that they might have lessons to impart to humans about our physical place in a changing world.

Vann R. Newkirk II: What America owes the planet

The forams’ shells keep the fossil record. When the cell dies, the shell remains. The shape and structural content of these shells, as determined by their immediate surroundings, gives precise information about the environments that they exist in today, or that existed millennia ago. Their fossils are snapshots: miniature witnessings of a particular place and moment of transformation. It is thanks to this place-bound existence that forams have contributed to our understanding of massive, global change over eons.

Foram-fossil-informed discoveries include: changes in sea levels during the Carboniferous period (more than 300 million years ago), fluctuations in the oxygen content of the oceans during the Jurassic (roughly 201 million to 145 million years ago), and glacial activity during the Quaternary (beginning about 2.5 million years ago). The fossils tell us about present-day conditions as well. On a slide under a microscope, scientists can read the work of those tiny cytoplasmic arms. Perhaps a shell has been partly dissolved by acid in an industrial waterway, or is deformed by an encounter with pollutants. As Pratul Kumar Saraswati, an earth sciences professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai, wrote: “Foraminifera is both the clock and the recorder of the Earth’s history. It has played a crucial role in developing our understanding of the evolution of life and the environment on Earth.”

Pulling myself back to the human-scale world, I lift my eyes and look out the window with a new clarity. I think of the river down the street that flooded about a decade ago; the summers of record-breaking heat; the shifting composition of birdsong in the trees; the human community, in all its messy complexity. From this site-specific view, I don’t long for escape. Foraminifera have helped me remember that I, too, am tiny and fleeting. The conditions of my physical existence are narrow. This river valley defines my visible horizon. I breathe oxygen made from these trees. And with that remembrance, I feel a wave of relief. This is a world I can touch—a scope I can manage.

Read: A plan to cool off the hottest neighborhoods

The benefits of local, place-based conservation and environmental work are well documented. The restorative power of maintaining a close relationship to nature is demonstrated as well: Forest bathing, for one—from the Japanese practice of shinrin-yoku, in which mindful, sensory immersion in forests is a therapeutic exercise—has been shown to reduce stress and alleviate symptoms of depression.

But I suppose what I’ve been seeking goes beyond even this. Like the foraminifera building their shells, I want to construct something for myself and my family. As the scientist and author Robin Wall Kimmerer, an enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, writes in Braiding Sweetgrass:

Being naturalized to place means to live as if this is the land that feeds you, as if these are the streams from which you drink, that build your body and fill your spirit. To become naturalized is to know that your ancestors lie in this ground. Here you will give your gifts and meet your responsibilities. To become naturalized is to live as if your children’s future matters, to take care of the land as if our lives and the lives of all our relatives depend on it. Because they do.

Being naturalized to place means to live as if this is the land that feeds you, as if these are the streams from which you drink, that build your body and fill your spirit. To become naturalized is to know that your ancestors lie in this ground. Here you will give your gifts and meet your responsibilities. To become naturalized is to live as if your children’s future matters, to take care of the land as if our lives and the lives of all our relatives depend on it. Because they do.

The very small reminds me that I exist within limits, within constraints, within particular environments and communities and moments in time. From this narrow space, I can find expanded agency with which to act, and with which to parent.

So this past winter, I paid attention to the northern cardinal that sang at dawn. I began reading my daughter her first chapter books. I also began the process of getting my prescribed-fire certification, hoping to help with local ecosystem restoration. This spring, my daughter and I will pull invasive knotweed from our yard, and we’ll plant the wildflower seeds we collected late last summer. When the weather turns warmer, I’ll take her to swim in the river. Through these acts, I can construct the foundation of a worldview. I can extend my arms to what I can touch and taste. I can practice building a structure, a house—a home—where caring for my daughter and caring for the planet are not two separate things.

## Why Is Trump Mad at the Zoo?

# Why Is Trump Mad at the Zoo?


作者:  | 发布时间: April 6, 2025, 8 AM ET


In search of “improper ideology” among the animals

The order came down late in the evening, when the orangutans, lions, and crocodiles would be resting. The next morning, March 28, the animals awoke to a new political reality: The world’s most powerful man had taken an acute interest in their place of lodging, the National Zoo. President Donald Trump had directed Vice President J. D. Vance to rid the Smithsonian Institution of all “improper ideology.” As a ward of the Smithsonian, the zoo was not only covered by this mandate; it was specifically mentioned as one of the facilities to be cleansed of wrongthink.

Trump’s order leaves little mystery about what he wants changed at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History and its National Museum of African American History and Culture. It calls for the removal of “divisive,” “race-centered ideology” from those museums, and says that their exhibits should instead instill pride “in the hearts of all Americans.” But the order’s text is silent on the nature of the zoo’s ideological transgressions, and my email to the White House asking what they might be went unanswered. Trump has not previously been counted among the zoo’s critics, who tend to lament the life of captivity suffered by its animals, not their potential indoctrination.

I reached out to the zoo staff to ask if they knew what the administration wanted changed. When I did not immediately hear back, I decided to visit the zoo, in the mindset of a freshly appointed cultural commissar. One morning this week, I arrived at its Connecticut Avenue entrance. Pollen-coated cars were lined up outside, and blossoms on the zoo’s magnolias were turning themselves inside out in the clear morning sun. Just a few hundred yards down its central path, near the Asia Trail, a food truck was already serving cocktails.

From the July 1919 issue: Pessimism and the zoo

On my way over to the zoo, I’d read the institution’s most recent strategic plan. In the introduction, former National Zoo Director Steven Monfort says that by going from a global population of 1 billion to 8 billion in only 200 years, “humans have made things very hard for wildlife.” It occurred to me that Vance might find this characterization a touch too Malthusian; he has often railed against what he perceives as anti-natalism in liberal culture. But the sight of parents carrying Moscow mules and margaritas away from the food truck suggested family-friendliness, at least of a certain kind.

At the zoo’s newly renovated Bird House, I joined a long line of families clustered around strollers, waiting to be let into the aviaries. In 2023, I’d met the zoo’s chief curator for birds, Sara Hallager, while reporting a story about the institution’s decision to euthanize a fox that may have killed 25 of its flamingoes. Hallager had told me that after the renovation, the zoo would no longer acquire birds from Africa, Asia, or South America. Its new exhibits would showcase only North American birds. Now I wondered: With this “America First” approach, had the zoo intended to obey (way) in advance? If so, that might explain why an enormous pink-marble sculpture of an eagle—salvaged from the original Penn Station—had been placed near the Bird House entrance.

As I moved deeper into the exhibit, this theory seemed less plausible. Its interpretive panels were not overtly political—I searched high and low for land acknowledgments and found none—but they also didn’t seem to have been designed to please Trump. For one thing, they’re printed in English and Spanish, a first for the zoo. They also celebrate the ability of migrating birds to move freely among the Amazon rainforest, North America, and the High Arctic.

I did find one potentially “divisive” panel in the turkey enclosure. It drew a distinction between North America’s Indigenous people, who hunted turkeys for thousands of years but took care not to wipe them out, and European colonists, who in just two centuries drove the birds to the brink of extinction. This may not be the sort of sentiment that “instills pride in the heart” of Americans. And yet it’s true.

Read: The aftermath of a mass slaughter at the zoo

Everywhere I went, I heard kids buzzing about the zoo’s new star attractions, two pandas named Bao Li and Qing Bao that Xi Jinping had sent from China as a gesture of friendship. A source at the Smithsonian Institution who was not authorized to speak to the press told me that before the pandas went on public view, the zoo had been besieged with messages from senators requesting advance meet and greets. I briefly entertained the thought that the zoo had ended up in Trump’s crosshairs because some key ally of his had been denied a picture with the bears. Whatever the case, Bao Li himself seemed entirely indifferent to politics. He sat, lolled back against a green hillside, chewing through whole sticks of bamboo like they were Twizzlers at the movies.

The zoo features less explicit climate advocacy than you might expect from an institution devoted to animal conservation. Most of it is concentrated in a single room in the Amazonia building. The Trump administration has been relentless about scrubbing government websites of all mentions of climate change, no matter how anodyne, but this was gentle stuff. In the center of a large mural from the 1990s recommending solar power, a kid wearing baggy clothes—now back in fashion—picks up trash in a forest. No fossil-fuel multinationals are named and shamed in the surrounding panels. The staff members in green vests did not appear to be indoctrinating anyone. They just gamely answered questions about the neon-blue tree frogs in a nearby terrarium.

The exit from Amazonia dumped me out onto a path that runs along the zoo’s southern edge. Traffic noise wafted down from the Duke Ellington Bridge, reminding me that I was not in a rainforest, but in the middle of Washington, D.C.—a city that Trump has derided as a “filthy and crime-ridden embarrassment to our nation.” Continuing down the path, I arrived at the Kids’ Farm exhibit, a shining scene of rural Americana that would not have been out of place on a butter label. Near the big red barn and stables, toddlers were perched on a fence, petting mules. A cow’s blotchy black coat shimmered in the bright heat of the afternoon. Like the Bootheel BBQ & Southern Catering food truck parked nearby, which promised to “feed your Southern soul,” the exhibit seemed designed to flatter, not antagonize, a narrow and nostalgic view of “real America.”

Before leaving the zoo, I popped into the visitor’s center. I confirmed that the bookstore inside was aimed at the nonpartisan animal lover, not the activist, and learned that the zoo usually holds a secular-coded celebration of Easter—its focus is nature’s post-winter bounty, not the newly risen Christ. The zoo’s website calendar does show that last year, and for several years prior, it also recognized International Family Equality Day. Local LGTBQ organizations participated in the event, and some described it as “Gay Day at the Zoo.” As part of the festivities, guests were able to watch a beaver or seal eat rainbow-dyed ice cake. Last year’s event also had a musical performance featuring themes of “climate justice, inclusion, queer identity, and community.” When I emailed the zoo to ask whether International Family Equality Day would continue this year, I did not receive a reply.

I could see how this celebration might inflame a social conservative, but the tame, one-day event did not seem like enough to merit the zoo’s inclusion in the executive order. Nor did any of the other things that I’d found—unless the administration is taking a “broken windows” approach to policing ideology.

Then again, I can’t claim that my audit was exhaustive. I had intended to visit every exhibit, but I ended up skipping the Reptile House. Not for lack of interest; it’s actually one of my favorite places at the zoo—the pythons and unblinking crocodiles provide a real encounter with the animal other. But the line was very long, with little shade. And so I can’t tell you for certain that the Reptile House isn’t a hotbed of critical race theory, or other MAGA heresies. Vance and his team will have to find out and let us know.

## What the Comfort Class Doesn’t Get

# What the Comfort Class Doesn’t Get


作者:  | 发布时间: April 6, 2025, 8 AM ET


People with generational wealth control a society that they don’t understand.

Recently, I accidentally overdrew my checking account. That hadn’t happened to me in years—the last time was in 2008, when I was running a small business with no safety net in the middle of a financial crisis. Back then, an overdrawn account meant eating canned soup and borrowing cash from friends only slightly better off than me. This time, I didn’t need to worry—I was able to move money from a different account. And yet all the old feelings—heart palpitations, the seizure of reason in my brain—came right back again.

I have one of those wearable devices that monitors my heart rate, sleep quality, activity level, and calories burned. Mine is called an Oura ring, and at the end of the day, it told me what I already knew: I had been “unusually stressed.” When this happens, the device asks you to log the source of your stress. I scrolled through the wide array of options—diarrhea, difficulty concentrating, erectile dysfunction, emergency contraceptives. I could not find “financial issues,” or anything remotely related to money, listed.

According to a poll from the American Psychiatric Association, financial issues are the No. 1 cause of anxiety for Americans: 58 percent say they are very or somewhat anxious about money. How, I wondered, was it possible that this had not occurred to a single engineer at Oura?

For all of the racial, gender, and sexual reckonings that America has undergone over the past decade, we have yet to confront the persistent blindness and stigma around class. When people struggle to understand the backlash against elite universities, or the Democrats’ loss of working-class voters, or the fact that more and more Americans are turning away from mainstream media, this is why.

America is not just suffering from a wealth gap; America has the equivalent of a class apartheid. Our systems—of education, credentialing, hiring, housing, and electing officials—are dominated and managed by members of a “comfort class.” These are people who were born into lives of financial stability. They graduate from college with little to no debt, which enables them to advance in influential but relatively low-wage fields—academia, media, government, or policy work. Many of them rarely interact or engage in a meaningful way with people living in different socioeconomic strata than their own. And their disconnect from the lives of the majority has expanded to such a chasm that their perspective—and authority—may no longer be relevant.

Take, for instance, those lawmakers desperately workshopping messages to working-class folks: More than half of congressional representatives are millionaires. In academia, universities are steered by college presidents—many of whom are paid millions of dollars a year—and governed by boards of trustees made up largely of multimillionaires, corporate CEOs, and multimillionaire corporate CEOs. (I know because I serve on one of these boards.) Once, a working-class college dropout like Jimmy Breslin could stumble into a newsroom and go on to win the Pulitzer Prize; today, there’s a vanishingly small chance he’d make it past security. A 2018 survey of elite newsrooms found that 65 percent of summer interns had attended top-tier colleges.

College attainment is more than a matter of educational status; it is also a marker of class comfort. Seventy percent of people who have at least one parent with a bachelor’s degree also have a bachelor’s degree themselves. These graduates out-earn and hold more wealth than their first-generation college peers. At elite schools, about one in seven students come from families in the top 1 percent of earners. Graduates of elite colleges comprise the majority of what a study in Nature labeled “extraordinary achievers”: elected officials, Fortune 500 CEOs, Forbes’s “most powerful,” and best-selling authors.

What we have is a compounded problem, in which people with generational wealth pull the levers on a society that they don’t understand. Whether corporate policies or social welfare or college financial aid, nearly every aspect of society has been designed by people unfamiliar with not only the experience of living in poverty but the experience of living paycheck to paycheck—a circumstance that, Bank of America data shows, a quarter of Americans know well.

The dissonance between the way the powerful think and how the rest of America lives is creating a lot of chaos. It can be seen in the rejection of DEI and “woke-ism”—which is about racism, yes, but also about the imposition of the social mores of an elite class. It can be seen above all in the rise of Donald Trump, who won again in part because he—unlike Democrats—didn’t dismiss the “vibecession” but exploited it by addressing what people were feeling: stressed about the prices of eggs.

These phenomena might not be rational. But anxiety isn’t rational. Studies have found that working through a challenging financial time can affect one’s brain as much as missing an entire night’s sleep, or a loss of 13 IQ points. Financial anxiety is linked with higher rates of depression and psychological distress, which can manifest in physical health issues such as heart disease and reduced immune response. The feeling of scarcity can also affect people’s ability to make sound decisions and retain information—not helpful when you can’t afford the late fee on a bill. In short, the haves are literally in a different head space than the have-nots.

Exacerbating this problem is widespread class dysmorphia. One reason so many well-off Americans feel capable of opining about less well-off Americans is because they don’t realize that they are, in fact, well-off in the first place. The explosion of the American billionaire class—from 272 individuals in 2001 to 813 in 2024, according to Forbes—has made millionaires feel relatively poor. There are more of them too. The number of Americans worth $30 million or more grew by 7.5 percent in 2023 alone. And still, according to a survey of millionaires done that year, two-thirds of them did not consider themselves wealthy.

Here’s the broader situation: 30 percent of American households are classified by Pew as low income, and 19 percent are upper income. And yet a 2024 Gallup survey found that only 12 percent of Americans identified themselves as “lower class” and just 2 percent as “upper class.” In short: No one wants to be perceived as poor, and no one rich ever feels rich enough.

As a result, the very term middle class has become a meaningless catchall for a disparate range of lived financial experiences. No wonder so much policy and rhetoric geared toward this group fails to stick. Who are these policies actually for? And what theoretical problems do they aim to address? Those of the third-generation college-educated social worker, whose parents helped her with a down payment on a house? Or those of the first-gen woman with student loans who holds the same job and lives in a rental apartment? Technically they earn the same wage and both likely see themselves as middle class, but they have extremely different lives because only one is a member of the comfort class.

Members of the comfort class are not necessarily wealthy. Perhaps one day they will earn or inherit sums that will put them in that category. But wealth is not the marker of the comfort class. Security is. An emergency expense—say a $1,200 medical bill—would send most Americans into a fiscal tailspin; for the comfort class, a text to Mom and Dad can render “emergencies” nonexistent.

This helps explain why the comfort class tends to vote differently. Someone who feels they don’t fundamentally need to worry about money if things go south will be more willing to vote on their values—issues like democratic norms or reproductive rights—than someone whose week-to-week concern is how inflation affects her grocery budget.

Many things drove voters to Trump, including xenophobia, transphobia, and racism. But the feeling that the Democratic Party had been hijacked by the comfort class was one of them. I recently saw—and admittedly laughed at—a meme showing a group of women from The Handmaid’s Tale. The text read: “I know, I know, but I thought he would bring down the price of eggs.”

To many Americans, classism is the last socially acceptable prejudice. It’s not hard to understand the resentment of a working-class person who sees Democrats as careful to use the right pronouns and acknowledge that we live on stolen Indigenous land while happily mocking people for worrying about putting food on the table.

Even when Americans of different classes are in close proximity, they tend to talk past one another. I still remember, my freshman year of college, coming back to my dorm to discover that my roommate had eaten the leftovers I’d saved from dinner the night before. I flew into a rage, and she had no idea why. She came from a household where leftovers were disposable. From her perspective, all she’d done was have a harmless drunken snack. From my perspective, she’d eaten my next meal, and I couldn’t afford another one.

I move in circles now where everyone’s zip code and alma mater alludes to a homogeneity of experience, but when I start discussing policy or politics with people—be they on the left or the right—I often feel that invisible gap yawn between us.

Just the other day, in honor of Indie Bookstore Day, I was asked to share a childhood memory of an independent bookstore. But I did not have a childhood memory of an independent bookstore. I grew up going to the library because there was no bookstore—independent or otherwise—in my blue-collar Brooklyn neighborhood. I didn’t go to a bookstore until I was a teenager, roaming Manhattan with my friends. For a moment, I felt embarrassed. But then I remembered how much unexamined presumption was behind the question. Most authors come from the comfort class, raised in homes full of books in quaint neighborhoods with local bookstores.

That’s a harmless example. But in the past eight weeks, life for working-class Americans has deteriorated in real ways. Millions of senior citizens are nail-biting about their Social Security benefits. People are worried for their jobs. The costs of eggs, orange juice, and utilities are on the rise. Mortgages and medical bills need to be paid. Rents will be due. Blood pressures will spike; judgments will be clouded; debts will no doubt be incurred. And the pundits and politicians, on all sides, will watch it from a safe, comfortable distance.

# The Cardboard-Carrying Opposition Arrives


作者:  | 发布时间: April 5, 2025


The “Hands Off” protest in Washington, D.C., drew thousands of people with a lot of feelings—but as-yet-inchoate anger at the Trump administration.

The opposition arrived in a flurry of painted cardboard.

Until this week, the 11th of Donald Trump’s second presidency, the resistance has not exactly been uppercase R. Any show of dissent by Democratic leadership has been virtually nonexistent, and protests against Trump’s policies have been small and sporadic. Citizen frustration with the new administration has registered nationally as little more than a distant rumble.

Today’s “Hands Off” protest, organized by a coalition of left-wing groups, was an attempt to raise the volume.

People carted their megaphones and rainbow flags to more than 1,200 sites across the country today—in D.C., of course, but also in Helena, Montana; Daytona Beach, Florida; and Dubuque, Iowa. The events spanned all 50 states, the organizers said, plus a few more exotic locales, such as Guadalajara, Lisbon, and Paris. Washington had expected to draw about 10,000 protesters; in the end, several times that showed up.

In interviews with some of those gathered today on the National Mall, demonstrators told me that they were under no illusion that Trump or Elon Musk would be much swayed by their anger or creative signage. The point, they said, was to show the rest of America that the opposition exists—and is widespread. “This is not for them,” Gina King, a retired teacher from New York City, told me. “This is for us.”

The first mass protest of this administration was well timed. The week began with Cory Booker’s record-breaking 25-hour tirade against Trump from the Senate floor. The monologue accomplished nothing tangible—though it threw Booker’s Oura-ring readings out of whack—but it was a welcome stunt for voters who have been craving louder public rage against the administration’s actions. (What says outrage more than a man willing to hold it for 25 hours?) Then, on Tuesday night, Democrats in Wisconsin won the first electoral test of Trump’s second presidency, by defeating a state-supreme-court candidate backed by Trump and $20 million from Musk. Also on Tuesday, one of the largest mass layoffs of federal workers to date began, when employees at the CDC and the FDA were dismissed. Finally, on Thursday, Trump’s tariffs sent Americans’ retirement savings plunging, triggered manufacturer layoffs, and forced CNBC to bring its bear-market graphic out of hibernation.

King, the retired teacher, carried a sign thanking Booker and Wisconsinites for their efforts in the fight against Trump. She protested the president during the Women’s March in early 2017, but this political moment is different, she told me. “It feels more desperate,” she said. “We should all be standing in front of the Supreme Court every day, in front of the National Institutes of Health every day.”

Half a dozen federal employees spoke with me at the protest, but none wanted to share their full name for fear of retribution from the Trump administration. “I’m here because I feel powerless,” said a man named Edward, who had just been forced out of his longtime government job. He carried a sign mocking the “five bullet points” that federal employees are now required to submit weekly to Musk’s DOGE.

“In the original Women’s March, we were very concerned with women’s rights, but now he’s touching all areas,” Tracie, an employee in the Department of Veterans Affairs, told me. She was willing to risk her job to show up at the protest, together with her daughter and granddaughter, she told me, because she wants America to see her anger. “The administration is completely discounting us. They’re saying we’re bought, we’re paid for, we’re bused in.” But the opposition to Trump is real, she said. “We are out here.”

On the Mall, it was difficult to pinpoint a chief complaint or singular demand. Hands off what, exactly? I asked.

There were so many things to be furious about. No single piece of cardstock could contain it all. People carried posters about the administration’s deportation of immigrants and dissident students; Laura Loomer’s Oval Office influence; Musk’s taking a chain saw to the federal government; the return of preventable diseases; the technological ineptitude of Trump’s defense officials; and attacks on abortion rights.

Many of those I spoke with cited creeping fascism. “There’s been a total disregard of habeas corpus,” Larry Bostian, a retiree from Silver Spring, Maryland, told me. “Democracy is in a death spiral.” Paul Singleton, an Air Force veteran from Stafford, Virginia, agreed. “I used to wonder, how did Hitler do what he did?” he said. “When Trump got into office and started appointing all these people, I stopped.”

Given the stakes, people wanted to know, where was Democratic Party leadership? Katrin Hinrichsen, a retired computer engineer from Connecticut, had brought a few signage options, including one that read Time to CHUCK Schumer. “I want some effective leadership of the Democratic minority,” she told me.

A few Democratic lawmakers addressed the rally in D.C., including Representatives Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. They were speaking on a stage somewhere amid the dense crowd gathered at the base of the Washington Monument. But most people couldn’t hear them; some had no idea there was a stage at all. Instead, parts of the rally devolved into a kind of hippie picnic, where sign carriers chatted in circles or plopped on the grass to eat sandwiches. One woman handed out nuts and dried fruit: “Cashews, anyone?” Another laughed with her friends—“The last time I felt safe in a crowd this big was at a Taylor Swift concert!”

“We’ve been scattered; we’ve been demoralized,” Bostian, the retiree from Silver Spring, told me, looking at the sea of people around him. “But this is awesome.”

The 2017 Women’s March connected protesters who kept in touch, established “Resistance” groups in their hometowns, and eventually helped elect a wave of new Democrats during the 2018 midterms. Today’s protesters think that they can do it again. They just need the rest of America to hear them.

## My Snail Mucin Is Caught in a Trade War

# My Snail Mucin Is Caught in a Trade War


作者:  | 发布时间: April 5, 2025


Tariffs could upend America’s love affair with Korean skin care.

When Korean skin care arrived in the United States several years ago, it became the stuff of legend among beauty enthusiasts. They raved about the sunscreen from the Korean brand Beauty of Joseon, which used advanced UV filters and left no white film behind; currently, it costs $18—its closest American counterpart would be about $40 and gloopier. Korean snail mucin promised to hydrate skin and improve fine lines, and prompted a buying frenzy, during which I did drop my own American dollars on a facial “essence” made from the secretions of snails. It has made my skin softer and only grossed me out twice.

Now my snail mucin is caught in a trade war. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s announcement of nearly global tariffs included a 25 percent hike on goods imported to the U.S. from South Korea; his administration has also repealed a customs loophole used by certain K-beauty exporters based in Hong Kong. Some skin-care enthusiasts had been preparing for possible trade disruptions—“spent my paycheck on korean skincare because those tariffs are about to go crazy,” one person posted in December. But now, they’re springing into action. “If you love your glow, get it now,” one skin-care influencer said on TikTok. “This is your last chance before it becomes unaffordable.”

Americans’ love affair with K-beauty was fostered by many years of free trade with South Korea, when our mucin came free of additional fees. The new tariffs will be “a good test to see how powerful the K brand is” in America, Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies U.S.–South Korea relations, told me—how much “soft power” Korea has accumulated here. If people have been buying K-beauty products because they love K-beauty (or K-pop or K-dramas), a price hike might not matter. But if they decide Korean products haven’t done that much for their skin, maybe they’ll switch to Neutrogena.

Beauty enthusiasts have, at times, gone to great lengths to import Korean serums, face masks, moisturizers, sunscreens, and the like from exporters usually based in Korea or Hong Kong. When Joshua Dupaya, a beauty influencer, first got into Korean products in 2016, for instance, he sourced them mostly from “trusted eBay sellers,” he told me. Cosmetics have become a fairly significant part of Korea’s exports—$10 billion globally last year, nearly $2 billion of which went to the United States. And certain K-beauty brands are more beloved here than in their home country. A co-founder of Beauty of Joseon said on a podcast in December, “We’re not really popular in Korea, I have to admit.” (Their Korean brand name means “beautiful woman in Joseon,” referring to the former, long-reigning Korean Joseon dynasty. She said Koreans think the name is “so tacky.”)

Part of K-beauty’s appeal is its price point—$15 for a high-quality moisturizing cream compares favorably with a $20 bottle of CeraVe, and extremely favorably with the $390 La Mer “crème” touted by the upper echelon of skin-care influencers and celebrities. Korean beauty products also contain ingredients that are uncommon in U.S. skin care, but that some American consumers swear by—Centella asiatica (Asiatic pennywort), rice water, ginseng extract, and of course, snail mucin. Their sunscreen is also just objectively better. The FDA is notoriously slow to approve new UV filters, which has meant that sunscreen in America is generally worse than it is in Europe and Asia. Formulations here feel chalkier and oilier, and they can leave white residue behind, because American chemists have a smaller palette of UV technology to draw from. For $12, someone could buy American sunscreen in uninspiring packaging that makes them look like a ghost. For the same $12, they could buy a K-beauty sunscreen in expensive-looking packaging that will not make them look like a ghost. When my friend returned from South Korea with an entire carry-on full of Korean skin care, we applied gobs of sunscreen, feeling like royalty with our advanced UV protection. For skin-care aficionados, K-beauty was an ideal trifecta: a product that feels luxurious, seems effective, and is relatively affordable.

Read: You’re not allowed to have the best sunscreens in the world

The tariffs will test whether a higher price outweighs those other benefits. Yesterday, the founder of the Korean company KraveBeauty announced on TikTok that the tariff will hit their next shipment to the U.S. and will have to be passed on to customers. “We’re still calculating what the implications of this new trade policy would be to our business, but this will change pretty much everything,” she said—for her company and others. She said the tariffs could upend her brand’s long-standing policy of keeping all their products under $28; those responding in the comments already spoke of K-beauty in the past tense; many included crying-face emoji.

Trump’s tariffs, of course, apply only to imported K-beauty. In the past several years, a handful of major K-beauty manufacturers have opened factories in the United States and will be able to avoid the tariffs, Yeo told me. But he expects that other Korea-based companies will wait about a year to see if these tariffs last and how U.S. consumers respond to the price hike before they consider relocating to America. “I don’t know if Koreans want to invest that much,” he said. “It depends how bullish you think the U.S. market is.” American demand for K-beauty has grown a lot, but brands will have to decide if they think it’ll keep growing. The U.S. isn’t their only market, and companies may choose to focus on countries such as China instead.

But if the tariff succeeds and more K-beauty is soon made in America, the industry could lose its major selling point: it is not made in America. These non-U.S. formulations are the “whole allure of using Korean beauty,” Dupaya told me. Beauty of Joseon recently began making versions of its beloved sunscreen specifically for the U.S. market, which meant it could use only UV technology approved by the FDA. Fairly or not, American users seem to think they have the same problems as U.S. sunblock. “Garbage,” a skin-care influencer said about one of the American formulations. “Absolute garbage.”

# Trump’s Preoccupation With Tariffs


作者:  | 发布时间: April 5, 2025


A dramatic shift in America’s trade policy has left economists warning of rising costs and the risk of a recession.

Donald Trump’s tariff announcement has baffled global leaders and forced markets to reckon with the fallout from America’s dramatic shift in international trade policy. Panelists joined on Washington Week With The Atlantic to discuss what tanking financial markets could mean for the president’s administration.

“Trade has not delivered the benefits that economists and politicians of both parties have been promising for decades,” David Leonhardt explained last night. While the United States economy has tended to work in favor of educated professionals, blue-collar workers have not benefited in the same ways. Adjustments to trade policy could be one way to address this, but Trump’s tariffs are “shambolic, they’re extremely high,” and “no one knows whether he’s going to take them back the next day,” Leonhardt continued.

Joining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Stephen Hayes, editor of The Dispatch; David Leonhardt, an editorial director for The New York Times editorial board; Kayla Tausche, a senior White House correspondent at CNN; Nancy Youssef, a national-security correspondent for The Wall Street Journal.

## Take Trump Seriously About Greenland

# Take Trump Seriously About Greenland


作者:  | 发布时间: April 5, 2025


The Danes seem to believe him, and so should Americans.

The United States grabbing land from an ally sounds like the stuff of a Netflix political thriller. But every American should contemplate three realities about Donald Trump’s aggressive desire to acquire Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory. First, unlike his usual shtick, in which he floats wild ideas and then he and his aides alternate between saying he was serious and saying he might have been joking, he means it. The Danes seem to believe him, and so should Americans. When institutions begin planning based on the president’s directions, as the White House is now doing, it’s no longer idle talk.

Second, Trump is calling for actions that likely contravene American and international law. He is undermining the peace and stability of an allied nation, while threatening a campaign of territorial conquest. He refuses to rule out an unprovoked war of aggression, a violation of the United Nations Charter and an international crime that would be little different in kind from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attempt to seize Ukraine. Finally, the almost-certain illegality of any attempt to seize Greenland against the will of its people and the Danish government means that if Trump directs the U.S. military to engage in such an operation, he could well precipitate the greatest civil-military crisis in American history since the Civil War.

How do we know Trump is serious? “One way or another,” the president crowed in his speech to a Joint Session of Congress last month, “we’re gonna get it.” A few weeks later, in case anyone missed the point, Trump told NBC: “We’ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100 percent.” Trump says a lot of strange things, certainly. He has mused about striking hurricanes with nuclear weapons, running for a constitutionally prohibited third term, staying in office even if he loses, and annexing Canada as the 51st state. But when a president publicly makes a vow to Congress to do something and then repeats that vow over and over, such statements are not trial balloons; they are policy.

And sure enough, Trump has followed up by sending Vice President J. D. Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, as unwelcome emissaries to Greenland. Vance—a neo-isolationist who apparently expresses opposition to the president’s plans only in Signal chats—has now embraced Trump’s old-school imperialism. Worse, Vance tried to press Trump’s case by boorishly criticizing Denmark’s relationship with the island, smarmily telling the Danes: “You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.” (Imagine the reaction in Washington if a European leader came, say, to Puerto Rico, castigated America’s management of the commonwealth, and urged the island to sever ties with the United States.) But at least he promised that military force, which to gain Greenland would have to be directed against Denmark, a NATO ally, was not going to be part of America’s efforts.

Trump, true to form, short-sheeted his hapless VP the next day by saying that military force was not, in fact, “off the table.”

On Monday, The Washington Post reported that the White House has begun work on estimating the costs of controlling Greenland in “the most concrete effort yet to turn President Donald Trump’s desire to acquire the Danish territory into actionable policy.” Once these kinds of meetings start taking place in the White House, the next step is usually to send out orders to the rest of the American national-security establishment, including the CIA and the Pentagon, to begin planning for various contingencies.

Even if the American people supported direct aggression against our own allies—by a large margin, they do not—public opinion is not a legitimate excuse for treaty-breaking. Treaties are the law of the land in the United States, and the president’s Article II powers as commander in chief do not allow him to wave a monarchical hand and violate those treaties at will. Just as Trump cannot legally issue orders to violate the Geneva Conventions or other agreements to which the United States is a signatory, he does not have the right to break America’s pact with NATO at will and effectively declare war against Denmark. When George W. Bush ordered U.S. forces into combat against Iraq in 2003, some of his critics claimed that his actions were illegal, but Bush at least had the fig leaf of a congressional resolution, as well as a lengthy list of UN Security Council resolutions. Trump will have literally nothing except his insistent greed and glory-seeking vanity.

If the U.S. military is given direct orders to seize Greenland—that is, if it is told to enter the territory of another nation, pull down that nation’s flag, and then claim the ground in the name of the United States—it will have been ordered to attack an ally and engage in a war of conquest, even if no shot is ever fired. These would be illegal orders, because they would violate not only our treaty obligations but also international prohibitions against unprovoked wars of aggression. At home, the president would be contravening the Constitution: Article II does not allow the commander in chief to run around the planet seizing territories he happens to want.

At that point, every senior commander, from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs on down, has a moral obligation to refuse to accept or support such a command. Pauline Shanks Kaurin, a military-ethics professor at the Naval War College (where I also taught for many years) told me, speaking in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the Defense Department, that civilian leaders have “the right to be wrong,” but that if the United States moves against Greenland, especially if both America and Denmark are part of NATO, “senior military leaders have an obligation to advise against this course of action and resign if necessary.” Shanks Kaurin added that this obligation might even extend to a requirement to refuse to draw up any plans.

But what if the orders are less obvious? Trump long ago mastered the Mafia-like talent of making his desires evident without actually telling others to engage in unsavory acts. In that case, he could issue instructions to the military aimed at intimidating Greenland that on their face are legal but that are obviously aggressive.

Retired Major General Charles Dunlap, who served as the deputy judge advocate general of the U.S. Air Force and now teaches law at Duke, suggested that Trump could take advantage, for example, of the wide latitude given to the United States in its basing agreement with Greenland. The president, Dunlap told me in an email, could choose to engage in “a gross misreading of the agreement” and move a large number of troops to Greenland as “a show of force aimed at establishing a fait accompli of some kind.” Military officers are required to presume that commands from higher authority are legal orders, and so a series of directives aimed at swarming forces into Greenland would likely be obeyed, Dunlap said, “because of the potential ambiguity” of such directives “as well as the inference of lawfulness.”

In any case, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have taken important steps to ensure that no one is left in the Pentagon to tell them that their orders might be unlawful. All of the top military lawyers whose job is to provide independent legal advice on such matters have been fired. And, as Dunlap notes, courts are notoriously reluctant to get involved in such questions, which is why Congress must step in. “The military,” he said, “ought not be put in the middle of something like this.”

Americans used to take their presidents far more seriously. Before Trump, when a president spoke, his words instantly became the policy of the United States government—for better or worse. When President Ronald Reagan caught his own aides flat-footed by bungling a policy message during a press conference in 1983, for example, a Reagan-administration official later said: “You can’t say ‘No, he didn’t mean it’ or ‘That’s not really government policy.’ That’s out of the question.”

But those days are long gone. As a direct result of Trump’s many off-the-cuff ruminations and long stretches of political glossolalia, Trump has convinced many Americans not to take their president at his word until it’s too late. (Consider how many people, for example, refused to believe that he would impose massive global tariffs, a policy they can now examine more closely by the light of a burning stock market.)

I realize that this entire discussion seems like utter lunacy. War against … Denmark? But when the president says something, it’s policy. Trump insists that he must be taken seriously. Americans and their elected representatives across the political spectrum should oblige him.

## Laura Loomer Is a Warning

# Laura Loomer Is a Warning


作者:  | 发布时间: April 5, 2025


No one else with direct access to the president has been as outwardly bigoted.

White House staffers, it seems, had better hope that they stay in Laura Loomer’s good graces. This week, Loomer—a far-right provocateur who has described herself as “pro–white nationalism” and Islam as a “cancer on humanity”—met with Donald Trump in the Oval Office. After she reportedly railed against National Security Council officials she believed were disloyal to the president, the White House fired six NSC staff members the next day. More firings could be on their way: Yesterday, a person close to the administration told my colleague Michael Scherer that “Loomer has been asked to put together a list of people at State who are not MAGA loyalists.”

Loomer doesn’t have an official job in the Trump administration, and the president has denied that she had anything to do with the NSC firings. But she is one of the president’s confidantes, and she has come to exercise a significant amount of influence over the White House. Lots of people in Trump’s inner circle have unlikely backgrounds (defense secretaries are not usually hired straight from Fox News), but Loomer’s is probably the least likely of them all. Over the past decade, she has earned a reputation as an unapologetically racist troll. In 2018, after she was banned from Twitter for criticizing then-incoming Representative Ilhan Omar and her Muslim faith, she famously handcuffed herself to the door of Twitter’s New York City headquarters. She was reinstated after Elon Musk bought the platform, and has continued to post racist things on X: In September, she suggested that a Kamala Harris election win would mean that “the White House will smell like curry.” (Loomer did not respond to a request for comment.)

Loomer’s power marks how little Trump now seems to care about being around people who have expressed racist and extremist ideas and kept racist and extremist company. She is a bit like the Forrest Gump of Trumpworld—an unlikely but persistent character who just keeps popping up during some of the right’s biggest moments. When Trump got off his private plane on his way to the presidential debate in September, Loomer appeared with him. The next day, when Trump traveled to New York for a 9/11-anniversary memorial, Loomer was again there with him. (She has called 9/11 an “inside job.”) As I wrote at the time, prominent Republicans did not like that their presidential candidate was associating himself with Loomer, and publicly challenged Trump over it. He seemingly has not listened.

Read: Laura Loomer is where Republicans draw the line

Loomer has also played a role in directing discourse on the right. She was integral to drumming up the hoax that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people’s pets, which became one of the most prominent right-wing causes du jour during the presidential campaign. In December, she instigated a war on the right over high-skilled immigration after she criticized the administration’s hiring of Sriram Krishnan as an AI-policy adviser and called attention to his past comments advocating for expanding H-1B visas. Most workers on H-1B visas are from India, and Loomer posted that Indian immigrants are “third world invaders.”

There is perhaps no one with direct access to the president who has been as outwardly and vociferously racist and bigoted. For all of the arguments that critics of Musk make about how he has boosted white supremacy on X, he has maintained a level of plausible deniability by never disparaging minority groups in a manner as direct as Loomer has. Someone like Loomer likely would not have had access to Trump in his first term. Richard Spencer never made it into Trump’s administration, and the president went out of his way to disavow the white nationalist. In 2018, when CNN reported that Darren Beattie, then a White House speechwriter, had spoken at an event that also featured a white nationalist, he was fired. But now Beattie has been hired to a senior role in this administration.

The president has already clearly established that his second term will be more extreme. Instead of the limited Muslim travel ban, he is pushing for mass deportations and has effectively shut down USAID, an agency largely devoted to helping poorer countries. But by welcoming Loomer into his inner circle, Trump is offering an even starker glimpse into how this administration is different. She is a testament to how much further to the right Trump has moved since his first term, and how much further he may be open to going.

What’s changed, and what’s stayed the same

This is an edition of The Wonder Reader, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a set of stories to spark your curiosity and fill you with delight. Sign up here to get it every Saturday morning.

Baseball, perhaps fittingly for America’s pastime, is a game of stubborn tradition and incremental change. This year, the Yankees will allow their players to don beards (and their fans to eat tiramisu out of little helmets). But women remain unable to play serious baseball, no matter how much they adore the sport. My colleague Kaitlyn Tiffany asks in our April magazine issue: “In a game in which everything matters, in which we who love it wish to see every possible outcome unfold, how can we stomach the absence of women’s baseball?” Today’s newsletter explores the changes to baseball in recent years, and what has stayed the same.
