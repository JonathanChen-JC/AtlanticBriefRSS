# Trump Is Willing to Take the Pain


作者:  | 发布时间: April 7, 2025, 7:40 PM ET


Advisers say the president is tuning out the markets and coverage and isn’t worried about the political impact of his tariffs—at least not yet.

During Donald Trump’s first term, advisers who wanted to check his most dramatic impulses reliably turned to two places to act as guardrails: the stock market and cable news. If the markets reacted badly to something Trump did, they found, he would likely change course to match Wall Street’s moves. And television’s hold over Trump was so great that, at times, his aides would look to get booked on a cable-news show, believing that the president would be more receptive to an idea he heard there than one floated during an Oval Office meeting.

But Trump’s second term looks different. Taking further steps today to escalate his global trade war, the president has ignored the deep plunges on Wall Street that have cost the economy trillions of dollars and accelerated risks of a bear market. He has tuned out the wall-to-wall coverage, at least on some cable networks, about the self-inflicted wounds he has dealt the United States economy. And unlike eight years ago, few members of Trump’s team are looking to rein him in, and those who think differently have almost all opted against publicly voicing disagreement.

Trump is showing no signs—at least not yet—of being encumbered by political considerations as he makes the biggest bet of his presidency, according to three White House officials and two outside allies granted anonymity to discuss the president’s decision making. Emboldened by his historic comeback, he believes that launching a trade battle is his best chance of fundamentally remaking the American economy, elites and experts be damned.

“This man was politically dead and survived both four criminal cases and an assassination attempt to be president again. He really believes in this and is going to go big,” one of the outside allies told me. “His pain threshold is high to get this done.”

What’s not clear, even to some of those closest to him, is what will count as a victory.

The president has likened his tariffs to “medicine” for a sick patient, but they have caused widespread confusion—particularly over whether Trump is committed to keeping the plan in place for years to boost U.S. manufacturing or whether he is using the new tariffs as a negotiating ploy to force other countries to change their policies.

Read: Trade will move on without the United States

“We have many, many countries coming to negotiate deals with us, and they’re going to be fair deals,” Trump told reporters today in the Oval Office, adding that he will not pause the tariffs despite another day of Wall Street turbulence. “No other president’s going to do this, what I’m doing.”

Markets plunged around the globe today for the third-straight trading day after Trump announced the sweeping “Liberation Day” set of tariffs—imposed on nearly all of the world’s economies—that almost instantly remade the United States’ trading relationship with the rest of the world. He has said that Americans should expect short-term pain (“HANG TOUGH,” he declared on social media) as he attempts to make the U.S. economy less dependent on foreign-made goods.

The blowback has been extensive and relentless. Other nations have responded with retaliatory levies. Fears of a recession have spiked. CEOs, after panicking privately for days, are beginning to speak out. Most cable channels have been bathed in the red of graphs depicting plunging markets, the stock ticker in the corner falling ever downward. Even Fox News, which has downplayed the crisis, has begun carrying stories about the impact on Trump voters who are worried about shrinking retirement accounts and rising prices. GOP lawmakers, usually loath to cross the White House, are mulling trying to limit the president’s economic authority. Senator Ted Cruz worried that the tariffs will cause a 2026 midterms “bloodbath,” while seven other GOP senators, including Trump allies such as Chuck Grassley, signed on to a bipartisan bill that would require Congress to approve Trump’s steep tariffs on trading partners.

Trump has stayed committed to the tariffs, and he lashed out today on social media at wavering Republicans, declaring them “Weak and Stupid” and warning, “Don’t be a PANICAN,” while his staff promised a veto of the bipartisan bill.

Yet even within Trump’s administration, the president’s moves have caused widespread confusion about what he is trying to get out of the tariffs. Peter Navarro, one of the administration’s most influential voices on trade, wrote in the Financial Times, “This is not a negotiation. For the US, it is a national emergency triggered by trade deficits caused by a rigged system.” Just a short time later, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote on social media that he had been tasked by Trump to begin negotiations with Japan and that he looks “forward to our upcoming productive engagement regarding tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, currency issues, and government subsidies.”

That public disconnect has brought private disagreements into the light, two of the White House officials and the other outside ally told me. Navarro and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller—who is perceived by many in Trump’s orbit as the most powerful aide on most issues—have embraced the idea that the tariffs should be permanent to erase trade deficits with other countries and even punish some nations, including China, for what the White House says are decades of unfair trade practices. Steve Bannon, the influential outside Trump adviser, has said on his podcast that bringing nations to the negotiating table is not enough and that the White House needs to insist that companies make commitments to bolster domestic manufacturing.

Bessent, a former hedge-fund manager who once worked for George Soros, has expressed some hesitancy behind closed doors about the tariffs, according to two of the White House officials. (The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) While stopping short of disagreeing with Trump, Bessent has tried in public interviews to soften the impact of the duties. Yesterday, he said on Meet the Press that “I see no reason that we have to price in a recession” and hinted that the tariffs could be temporary because a number of nations have already sought negotiations. Meanwhile, Elon Musk, who to this point has been Trump’s most visible adviser, today posted a well-known video of the economist Milton Friedman touting free trade. That followed a weekend during which Musk took aim at Navarro, suggesting that his push for steep trade barriers is too extreme.

Trump himself hardly cleared up the inconsistent messaging when asked in the Oval Office this afternoon if the tariffs are a negotiating tool or are going to be permanent. “Well, they can both be true,” Trump said. “There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations, because there are things that we need beyond tariffs.”

Earlier in the day, the confused messaging had a material impact on the markets: A social-media post misconstruing a comment by National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett to suggest that Trump might pause the tariffs for 90 days briefly sent markets upward. The White House clarified that no change in policy was planned, prompting markets to go back down.

That brief rally also seemed to reveal Wall Street’s wishful thinking that the president will soon back off the tariffs—the same sense of optimism that mistakenly led investors to hope before last week that Trump’s campaign rhetoric about tariffs was just a bluff or a negotiating tactic. In a lengthy social-media post yesterday, the hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman, a staunch Trump supporter, wrote that the president needs to pause the tariffs or risk “a self-induced economic nuclear winter.”

Annie Lowrey: Here are the places where the recession has already begun

Many Republicans had hoped that Trump’s economic policy would focus on extending his 2017 tax cuts (which disproportionately helped businesses and the wealthy) while also tackling inflation. But although Trump has long possessed a flexible ideology, one of his few consistent principles, dating to at least the 1980s, is a belief in tariffs, even though many economists believe that tariffs are outdated and ineffective in an era of globalization.

Trump has done little to enact his campaign promise to bring down prices and has surprised some observers with his willingness to endanger his poll numbers by taking on such a risky tariff scheme. Although Trump is notorious for changing his mind on a whim, he is for now ignoring the complaints from business leaders and the warnings about the tariffs’ effect on his own voters.

There was another small marker recently of how Trump has changed from eight years ago. During his first administration, he regularly grew angry about any media coverage—particularly photographs—that portrayed him unflatteringly. Over the weekend, the front page of The Wall Street Journal carried a photo taken of Trump on Saturday, as he rode in the back of a vehicle wearing golf attire, waving, and talking on the phone, mouth open. The headline read: “Trump Heads to Golf Club Amid Tariff Turmoil.”

Yet Trump has not complained about the coverage, one of the White House officials told me. And he golfed again yesterday.

# Just Like the Old Trump


作者:  | 发布时间: April 7, 2025, 5:32 PM ET


The past couple of weeks have shown that the White House truly has no idea what it’s doing.

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Chaos is terrifying, which is perhaps why traders were so relieved this morning when Walter Bloomberg tweeted “HASSETT: TRUMP IS CONSIDERING A 90-DAY PAUSE IN TARIFFS FOR ALL COUNTRIES EXCEPT CHINA.” Who exactly Walter Bloomberg is has never been clear, but his feed of financial-news headlines has a large following, and stock indices shot up briefly upon this morsel of hope.

And then—cold, hard reality. Bloomberg’s tweet referred to a Fox News interview with Kevin Hassett, the director of Donald Trump’s National Economic Council, who’d been asked about a pause and replied, “I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.” (Trump never rules out anything, of course.) The White House quickly labeled the report “fake news,” and the markets returned to their previously scheduled slide.

Over the past couple of weeks, the administration has shown again and again that it truly has no idea what it’s doing. The Trump administration has been accidentally texting war plans to my boss, Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg; deporting a person it admits it had no legal reason to deport; and firing people it quickly realizes it needs back. If the start of Trump’s second presidency showed an unfamiliar ability to impose its will, the recent stretch has served as a reminder that Trump is Trump, his administration is not run by polished professionals, he hasn’t learned much since his first term, and there’s no master plan that’s going to save the country.

One of the recurring ideas of the first Trump administration was that he was finally becoming “presidential.” Just like Marx said, this arrived first as tragedy—people really believed it—and then as farce, most prominently in an absurdist X thread by the comedian Megan Amram. By the end of 2020, pretty much no one appeared to buy into the notion.

Then it somehow made a comeback. Observers convinced themselves that they saw a more disciplined Trump—or at least a more disciplined Trump campaign. (My colleague Tim Alberta’s contemporaneous reporting showed the weaknesses of this belief.) They grew frustrated with former President Joe Biden’s age, or his economic policies, or his messaging, and they convinced themselves that Trump couldn’t be that bad. Because hey, chaos is terrifying, and it’s more reassuring to assume some secret plan exists that’s more clever than what meets the eye.

Unfortunately, the only secret plans appear to be the ones that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sent to Goldberg. Last week, my colleague Nick Miroff reported that the government had mistakenly arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man with protected legal status, and flew him to El Salvador, where he is imprisoned. This is nefarious, but it’s not part of some nefarious scheme; they just messed up. A Justice Department lawyer who admitted as much in court last week has been placed on leave as punishment. The lawyer, Erez Reuveni, is a career Justice Department lawyer, but he’s no liberal plant: He was promoted into his current role by Trump officials just two weeks ago. (The Supreme Court today agreed to an administration request to pause an order requiring it to bring Abrego Garcia home. The Justice Department acknowledged “an administrative error” but insisted that Abrego Garcia is now in Salvadoran custody and beyond U.S. reach—a logic that might be funny if it weren’t so treacherous.)

Nor does the White House have a master plan for the tariffs. Officials were working right up until the last minute to prepare a plan for Trump’s supposed Liberation Day on April 2. Perhaps they should have kept working. The final result includes embarrassing errors like tariffs on uninhabited islands, or an archipelago that houses only U.S. and British military personnel, but it has more fundamental flaws. As Kevin Corinth and Stan Veuger of the conservative American Enterprise Institute explain, the formula the administration used includes a very basic error: confusing retail and import prices. The result is two variables that cancel each other out.

Yet the idea that the president would willingly drive the country toward a likely recession is hard to believe. No wonder that some Very Serious People in finance spent the days leading up to April 2 seriously considering something referred to as the “Mar-a-Lago Accord,” which sought to make sense of Trump’s actions but which my colleague Rogé Karma aptly labeled “QAnon for tariffs.”

Now the tariffs are here, and trillions in market value is gone. Trump’s major response to jitters today was to threaten even higher tariffs on China—showing that he is making it up as he goes and isn’t deterred by the prospect of inflicting more chaos. As long as you don’t look at your own portfolio, you might get some schadenfreude from the X posts of Bill Ackman. The veteran activist investor became a mainstream figure, and a “main character,” in late 2023. Although he was a longtime Democrat, Ackman became furious at campus protests against the Israeli government, and at woke culture more broadly, and embraced Trump. Now Ackman is apoplectic about tariffs, warning of “a self-induced, economic nuclear winter.”

Trump is doing exactly what he said he was going to do. Ackman apparently didn’t believe it. When you’ve become a billionaire, it’s easy to be optimistic: Things have worked out well for you so far! It’s also easy to assume that Trump’s punishment will never come for you. This is the mortar of the Trump coalition: a desire for Trump to take on your adversaries, and a conviction that you’ll never be the one facing his wrath.

Some Trump supporters have already been forced to recognize that they’re vulnerable. The realization has been slower for others, such as the very wealthy. They can overlook incidents like Abrego Garcia’s deportation, although as I have written, they should not: Once the executive branch finds a way to ignore the law for one person, it can ignore the law for any person. Trump’s malice has now visited upon the lawyers whom the rich employ, and now his incompetence is coming for their portfolios. They can’t say they had no warnings.

What the Comfort Class Doesn’t Get

By Xochitl Gonzalez

America is not just suffering from a wealth gap; America has the equivalent of a class apartheid. Our systems—of education, credentialing, hiring, housing, and electing officials—are dominated and managed by members of a “comfort class.” These are people who were born into lives of financial stability. They graduate from college with little to no debt, which enables them to advance in influential but relatively low-wage fields—academia, media, government, or policy work. Many of them rarely interact or engage in a meaningful way with people living in different socioeconomic strata than their own. And their disconnect from the lives of the majority has expanded to such a chasm that their perspective—and authority—may no longer be relevant.

## ‘A Path of Perfect Lawlessness’

# ‘A Path of Perfect Lawlessness’

The Trump administration’s arguments in a high-profile immigration case have much broader implications.

This article was updated on April 7, 2025, at 8:40 pm.

The Supreme Court is about to decide whether the Trump administration can exile Americans to a gulag overseas and then leave them there.

The Trump administration wants everyone to believe that the case challenging its deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador’s infamous Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, is about the government’s right to deport undocumented immigrants, or gang members, or terrorists. But it’s actually about whether the United States government can kidnap someone off the street and then maroon them, incommunicado, in a prison abroad with little hope of release. Human-rights groups have said that they have yet to find anyone freed from CECOT, and the Salvadoran government has previously said anyone imprisoned there will “never leave.”

Today, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to lift a federal-court order telling the administration to retrieve Abrego Garcia. This afternoon, Chief Justice John Roberts blocked the order temporarily.  A short time later, the majority issued a per curiam decision in a separate case, allowing deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to continue, albeit under judicial supervision.

As my colleague Nick Miroff reported, the Trump administration acknowledged in court that Abrego Garcia was deported because of an “administrative error.” Abrego Garcia has been in the U.S. since he was 16, having fled El Salvador and come to the U.S. illegally after gangs threatened his family. He is married to an American citizen, and has a 5-year-old child. In 2019, a judge gave him a protected status known as “withdrawal of removal,” ordering the government not to send him back to El Salvador. The Trump administration has alleged that Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, based on the word of a single anonymous informant six years ago, and the fact that Abrego Garcia was wearing Chicago Bulls attire.

Adam Serwer: Trump’s Salvadoran gulag

In its majority opinion rejecting the government’s argument, though, judges from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that the record “shows that Abrego Garcia has no criminal history, in this country or anywhere else, and that Abrego Garcia is a gainfully employed family man who lives a law abiding and productive life,” and that “if the Government wanted to prove to the district court that Abrego Garcia was a ‘prominent’ member of MS-13, it has had ample opportunity to do so but has not—nor has it even bothered to try.” Abrego Garcia is not an exception—an analysis by CBS News found that three-quarters of the more than 200 men deported to El Salvador lacked criminal records.

Even though the Trump administration conceded that Abrego Garcia was deported by mistake, it is insisting that federal courts cannot order his return. “A judicial order that forces the Executive to engage with a foreign power in a certain way, let alone compel a certain action by a foreign sovereign, is constitutionally intolerable,” it said in a court filing. The implications of this argument may not be immediately obvious, but if federal courts cannot order the return of someone exiled to a foreign gulag by mistake, then the administration is free to exile citizens and then claim they did so in error, while leaving them to rot.

As the legal scholar Steve Vladeck wrote, “A world in which federal courts lacked the power to order the government to take every possible step to bring back to the United States individuals like Abrego Garcia is a world in which the government could send any of us to a Salvadoran prison without due process, claim that the misstep was a result of ‘administrative error,’ and thereby wash its hands of any responsibility for what happens next.” If the Trump administration prevails here, it could disappear anyone, even an American citizen. Several have already been swept up and detained in recent ICE raids. Whether you can imagine yourself in Abrego Garcia’s position or not, all of our fates are ultimately tied to his.

Deporting people without due process is what’s actually “constitutionally intolerable,” given that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee due process of law. Disappearing people off the street and exiling them is “constitutionally intolerable” for the same reasons. Sending people who have never been convicted of any crime to CECOT, a prison where advocates allege that inmates are routinely abused, may also be “constitutionally intolerable,” given the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. But whatever their constitutional status, all of these things should be morally intolerable to any decent human being.

Read: An ‘administrative error’ sends a Maryland father to a Salvadoran prison

This should be one of those cases in which the justices are unanimous. If the Constitution’s commitments to due process mean anything, they should mean that the government cannot send people to be imprisoned by a foreign nation without a shred of evidence that they’ve committed any crime. American “history and tradition” produced a system designed to reject arbitrary powers such as these, with the conscious fear that “parchment barriers” would provide little protection against an “overbearing majority” willing to violate rights. Nevertheless, I have little doubt that someone will try to argue that the Framers who wrote two due-process clauses into the Constitution actually loved disappearing people to foreign prisons.

“The facts of this case thus present the potential for a disturbing loophole: namely that the government could whisk individuals to foreign prisons in violation of court orders and then contend, invoking its Article II powers, that it is no longer their custodian, and there is nothing that can be done,” Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, wrote in his concurrence. “It takes no small amount of imagination to understand that this is a path of perfect lawlessness, one that courts cannot condone.”

This is eloquent and correct, but this lawlessness is happening precisely because the nation’s highest court condoned it in advance. The right-wing justices on the Roberts Court have repeatedly rewritten the Constitution to Donald Trump’s benefit, first by nullifying the anti-insurrection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment, and then by inventing an imperial presidential immunity that is nowhere in the text of the document. It is no surprise that Trump is now acting as though he is above the law. After all, the Roberts Court all but granted him permission.

In the ruling in the Alien Enemies Act case, although the Court unanimously decided that the detainees are entitled to judicial review, its decision states those deported have to challenge their detentions in the jurisdiction where they are held. The risk, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted in her dissent, is that “individuals who are unable to secure counsel, or who cannot timely appeal an adverse judgment … face the prospect of removal directly into the perilous conditions of El Salvador’s CECOT, where detainees suffer egregious human rights abuses.”

“The implication of the Government’s position is that not only noncitizens but also United States citizens could be taken off the streets, forced onto planes, and confined to foreign prisons with no opportunity for redress if judicial review is denied unlawfully before removal,” Sotomayor wrote. “History is no stranger to such lawless regimes, but this Nation’s system of laws is designed to prevent, not enable, their rise.”

The Roberts Court should not congratulate itself over this ruling. America remains on the path to “perfect lawlessness” Wilkinson described, largely thanks to the justices.

## <em>The White Lotus</em> Doesn’t Stick the Landing

# The White Lotus Doesn’t Stick the Landing


作者:  | 发布时间: April 7, 2025, 4:12 PM ET


By packing in too many narrative beats, the latest season of Mike White’s anthology series lost sight of itself.

This article contains spoilers through the Season 3 finale of  The White Lotus.  On The White Lotus, misdirection abounds. Each installment of the writer-director Mike White’s acerbic satire opens with a guest at the titular hotel chain stumbling upon a dead body, before rewinding a week to introduce a motley crew of patrons and staff who might each end up being the deceased. As these characters and their complicated relationships come into view, the question of the corpse’s identity recedes into the background; the fatal arc rarely plays out as anticipated, and is not always relevant to each character’s story.

The White Lotus, which began as a COVID-era limited series filmed in Hawaii, has always been a closely observed study of wealth and its excesses, whether carnal or material. This season, filmed mostly on the Thai island of Ko Samui, used the new setting to nudge its characters toward pursuits beyond the flesh. Guests got a crash course in Buddhist principles, a reflection of White’s own interest in the religion and its philosophies. The pacing was slower, and the tone less raucous, than in seasons past, as characters served up meditations on life, death, and the things we do to survive in between. But last night’s Season 3 finale proved that the show isn’t above an obvious, anticlimactic ending—and hasn’t quite transcended its original formula.

Perhaps more than any other TV show airing now, The White Lotus has inspired fans to share their theories about the symbolism, pop-culture allusions, and real-world inspiration on view—and how that all might manifest in the finale’s on-screen deaths. In seven preceding episodes, Season 3 zoomed in on the insecurities, selfishness, and devious choices of a wide-ranging ensemble cast. Each narrative thread seemed to tease a potentially explosive ending, and the White Lotus team promised a shocking finale. The steady stream of online chatter helped propel this season to some of the show’s highest-ever ratings, but it also inadvertently revealed the trouble with this season’s writing. Instead of deepening the psychological and interpersonal inquiries of its character studies, The White Lotus simply bombarded viewers with more—more characters, more accents, more episodes, more dead bodies, more Easter eggs to scrutinize—only to end up with a predictable outcome.  The show has always been more invested in skewering its living hotel patrons than obsessing over the specifics of any one character’s demise. But the finale undermined—and wholly ignored—some of the season’s more interesting ideas. One of the season’s main stories has focused on Rick (played by Walton Goggins), a morose middle-aged man vacationing with his earnest, wide-eyed girlfriend, Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood). Rick spent most of the season chasing Jim (Scott Glenn), the man he believed to be his father’s killer, before confronting him in the penultimate episode. Rick managed to walk away from the encounter without harming Jim, and the resulting calm he felt afterward marked a notable shift for a man whose entire understanding of himself was shaped by the death of his father. It also represented a heartening development in his relationship with Chelsea, who had constantly begged Rick not to choose violence.

Read: Reclaim imperfect faces

Near the end of the finale, all of that progress was erased. A new encounter with Jim triggers Rick’s rage, leading to a wild shoot-out across the hotel grounds. And right after Rick does shoot Jim, he learns that Jim was actually his father—with no setup or follow-through. Just moments before, Chelsea had pleaded with Rick to “stop worrying about the love you didn’t get” and “think about the love you have.” Of course, Rick doesn’t, and his refusal leads to their deaths, too. The shootings played out in rapid succession, filling the final 20 minutes of the episode with a barrage of gunplay that felt like the rushed conclusion to an action film. Where the Season 2 finale imbued its important action scenes with a modicum of whimsy, last night’s episode presented little by way of humor, stylistic finesse, or emotional release. By the time Rick tells a dying Chelsea that they’ll be together forever, just like she’d said throughout the season, the words ring hollow.  Other plotlines stacked up the possibility of immense tragedy, only to pull back at the last minute. Earlier in the season, embattled father Tim Ratliff (Jason Isaacs) had become desperately suicidal after learning he was under investigation for financial crimes. Convinced that his family would not survive the loss of their wealth, he seemed prepared to poison not only himself but also his wife and two of his children. For a short stretch in the last episode, it seemed like his younger son, Lochlan (Sam Nivola), would inadvertently die instead. But after accidentally drinking a poisoned milkshake, Lochlan was … fine, and his family soon boarded a boat departing the island (with no acknowledgment of the shoot-out that had just killed multiple people). For a moment, Tim seems ready to tell his wife and children what will happen when they get back to the United States—but then the scene ends. After eight episodes of the show hinting at a possible murder-suicide, the finale sends them off with nothing worse than a stomachache.

Another scene struck a very different note, in a marked contrast to the plot-heavy proceedings. Throughout the season, a trio of childhood friends—Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan), Kate (Leslie Bibb), and Laurie (Carrie Coon)—had navigated their middle-age ennui by gossiping about one another. Then, in a lovely monologue, Laurie admitted that their bond was one of the most important things in her life. “I don’t need religion or God to give my life meaning, because time gives it meaning,” she says tearfully. “We started this life together. I mean, we’re going through it apart, but we’re still together.” It’s a beautiful sentiment, bringing some welcome closure to a true-to-life dynamic. But sandwiched in between so much plot, the scene’s gravity was undercut. If the finale had stopped trying to do so much, perhaps it could have actually given us some emotional satisfaction.

On the first episode of Everybody’s Live With John Mulaney, Netflix’s new talk show, the comedian gathered a panel of 11 actors who have played Willy Loman, the tragic protagonist of the classic play Death of a Salesman. He lobbed queries at the group, which included recognizable stars (among them Christopher Lloyd) and fresh-faced students, asking them to answer in character—but not about their performances or the play itself. Instead, the host asked such questions as “How much screen time should an adolescent get?” and “Are movies too violent?”

This meeting of the Willy Lomans was a strange, charming, and original bit, the kind of thing that seemed like it could only have sprung from Mulaney’s mind; he’s long delighted in giving old-school American entertainment a modern tweak. It was a fantastically irrelevant piece of comedy that also let the comedian react to contemporary issues in his own specific manner: by gleefully summoning avatars of the broken American working man and using them to expose the ridiculous way we live now. This type of self-assured humor is core to Mulaney’s comedic sensibility—and a large part of what’s made his late-night experiment so fascinating.

Mulaney may very well roll his eyes at that analysis, and he’d probably be right to do so. The bulk of Everybody’s Live is clearly designed for the comedian’s amusement. The hour-long program, which airs Wednesdays and is Netflix’s first foray into weekly live programming, builds upon the six-episode series he did for the streamer in 2024, called Everybody’s in L.A. The ornery character actor Richard Kind is his announcer, barking non sequiturs from behind a podium. Each episode has a conversation topic with no particular connection to the week at hand, like lending people money or funeral planning; each one is just a subject of interest to Mulaney. His guests are a mix of celebrities and experts, yet the celebs make no effort to plug whatever current projects they may have. And Mulaney takes calls from viewers live on air, though if the person on the other end of the line rambles for too long, he will bark at them to hurry up.

In constructing this loopy hangout session, Mulaney is taking the standard talk-show format and languidly injecting it with some disorder. The audience never knows what might happen, but there’s also little chance of something truly maniacal going on. Mostly, the host is happy to chitchat, with pals and strangers alike. He has shown that he is as much an acolyte of the storied genre as he is an eager dismantler of it: When he emerged as one of the leading stand-up comedians of his generation, Mulaney already had more than a little Johnny Carson to him. Like the late talk-show veteran, he’s a reedy-voiced midwesterner with a face every mother could love. Mulaney’s schtick, however, carries a salty edge. It wasn’t too hard, while watching him perform onstage, to imagine the comedian ending up somewhere like The Tonight Show, delivering zingers from behind a desk.

But late night has become a rapidly decaying format, as broadcast television—where it primarily lives—slouches toward extinction. CBS just canceled After Midnight, the variety program hosted by the stand-up comic Taylor Tomlinson, which airs after Stephen Colbert’s Late Show; the network has no plans to replace the series or fill its time slot. When Conan O’Brien retired from hosting Conan on TBS, the cable channel began airing sitcom reruns in its stead. The Tonight Show, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, is still a TV institution; meanwhile, its excellent sister show Late Night With Seth Meyers, has been shedding budget, losing the house band last year. ABC will seemingly retain Jimmy Kimmel as long as he wants to keep doing Jimmy Kimmel Live—it’s currently in its 23rd season—yet his deal expires this year, and he’s yet to sign a new one. Shows from other, newer entrants in the late-night field, like the comedy duo Desus and Mero and the Daily Show fixture Samantha Bee, also ended prematurely.

Mulaney has many advantages at Netflix that his conventional-television peers don’t, however. He doesn’t have to worry as much about ratings; he does only one show a week, with just 12 episodes currently planned, and there’s more room to break from the status quo on a streaming service that has sought to upset traditional media’s apple carts. At the same time, Everybody’s Live harkens back to a chattier, looser era—like The Merv Griffin Show, where interviews could run half an hour or longer, or Tom Snyder’s The Tomorrow Show, a newsier hour of talk that aired after Carson’s The Tonight Show for eight years. Focusing the conversation on a particular subject reminds me of Bill Maher’s shows Politically Incorrect and Real Time, though Maher tackles more topical material; taking live calls reminds me of the stand-up comic Chris Gethard’s truly riotous The Chris Gethard Show, which is still maybe the most electrifying attempt to remake the late-night genre of the past decade.

The resulting balance of serious and silly is perfectly amusing for a Mulaney fan like myself. Others might find the pithy gags a touch indulgent: Mulaney spends time fumbling around with a delivery robot and tossing beverages to his befuddled guests. The variety of pretaped sketches, including the Willy Lomans bit, may also fit into this category. But the pointlessness, as O’Brien emphasized in his conversation with Mulaney on his podcast last week, is part of the point. Rather than adopt the typical structure of a late-night show—celebrities telling cheeky, canned stories boiled down to 10 minutes or less—the host embraces weird, sometimes confusing antics.

O’Brien, one of Mulaney’s most apparent influences, articulated the appeal of this approach in their conversation: “We live in this era where I think people got intoxicated at some point with comedy having a point, and comedy meaning something, and comedy driving the conversation,” O’Brien said, referring to Mulaney’s absurdist spin on Death of a Salesman. “I think I just love when there’s a really funny idea that’s very creative.” An idiosyncratic sketch like that one, he added, “has a power that’s hard to understand, but it’s there.”

Read: Comedians only care about comedy

The “funny first” sensibility motivated O’Brien during his many years as a late-night television host. To him, Mulaney, and their ilk, it’s much more important for comedy to be purely, anarchically funny, rather than speaking directly to “the moment.” O’Brien was also being a little coy: His own material can still speak to current events, even if he never trolls for “clapter,” a term Meyers coined to describe the reaction of an audience demonstrating its approval instead of laughing spontaneously. O’Brien still has fun with societal foibles, just in a less direct fashion than some of his contemporaries. Mulaney’s approach to social commentary on his show is even more subtle; sometimes, concentrating a sketch on a character like Willy Loman is enough.

Mulaney’s comedic priorities have thus far kept Everybody’s Live focused—or as focused as such a program can be. Take a recent episode about cruises, which featured Ben Stiller, Quinta Brunson, and Mulaney’s frequent comedy partner Nick Kroll, along with a befuddled industry expert named Anne Kalosh. Kalosh sat chuckling as other panelists confessed they’d never been on a cruise and had no real interest in them, while Mulaney rolled with that irony chipperly. And when one caller’s story about life on a boat went on too long, Mulaney hung up on him. “It’s become a yarn, and we don’t have time for yarn,” he explained to his guests. “It’s a little rude, but also, it’s rude to waste the whole globe’s time.” He might be here to hang out, yet he’s still putting on a show.

# What Makes Modern Measles Outbreaks Different

Unvaccinated children are becoming unvaccinated adults, who are at risk of dangerous complications.

Updated at 12 p.m. on April 7, 2025

The current U.S. measles outbreak follows, in some ways, a classic pattern: The virus first found a foothold where childhood vaccination is low—among Mennonites in Texas, in this case—before rapidly spreading to other communities and states. It has sickened mostly children and has now killed a second child, whose death was reported this weekend. With cases still ticking up, experts expect the outbreak to persist for a year.

Look closely at the outbreak’s edges, though, and the patterns are more unusual: It’s not just children getting measles. Where Texas’s outbreak has spilled over into New Mexico, for example, half of the confirmed cases and one potential death involve adults, largely unvaccinated. Last year, too, adults older than 20 accounted for more than a quarter of U.S. measles cases. This is all in keeping with what experts have warned: Adults are now susceptible to this childhood disease.

Doctors tend to be unfamiliar with adult measles, because adults used to not get it. In the prevaccine era, the extremely contagious virus blazed through with such frequency that virtually all children were infected with measles before reaching adulthood. Today, vaccine coverage is widespread enough that unvaccinated children can easily live to adulthood without ever encountering the virus, but not uniformly high enough to prevent outbreaks altogether. Vaccinated adults can get occasional breakthrough cases, but the illness tends to be much milder. Unvaccinated adults, however, are a uniquely vulnerable group, because measles only becomes nastier and deadlier with age.

The risk from measles follows a U-shaped curve, Neal Halsey, a measles expert and professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins, told me. On the left are children under 5, whose still-maturing immune systems might struggle to fend off the virus. On the right are adults; the rise in mortality gets steeper and steeper over time, eventually surpassing the mortality in young children. When measles managed to reach isolated villages in the past—such as when a sick sailor brought it to a remote part of Greenland in 1951—outbreaks on “virgin soil” proved especially deadly for adults. Of the 77 people who died in Greenland then, 59 were over the age of 35. Measles may be a classic childhood illness, but it mostly killed adults there.

This age gradient of measles severity persists today. Although the typical symptoms of rash, fever, and cough are the same, adults—even healthy adults in their 20s and 30s—grow more prone to the severe complications that might prove dangerous and even fatal. Pneumonia and encephalitis, or infections of the lungs and brain respectively, are more common. One in four adults with measles will need to be hospitalized, a rate that is roughly two to three times that of school-age children.

Matthew Goetz still has “vivid memories” of adult patients he treated as an infectious-disease doctor during a 1988–90 outbreak in Los Angeles. The first patient wasn’t diagnosed until after a couple of days in the hospital, he recalls, because doctors had little reason to suspect that an adult would have measles. Several more soon showed up. Of the 33 patients eventually admitted to the public hospital where Goetz worked, nine had to be transferred to the ICU. Six developed respiratory failure so severe that they needed a ventilator.

When measles returned to Southern California with the Disneyland outbreak of 2014–15, adults made up more than half of those cases. The two sickest patients of the outbreak, who both needed to be ventilated for pneumonia, were also adults, Kathleen Harriman, an epidemiologist at the California Department of Public Health, told me.

Why measles gets deadlier with age of first contact is still not entirely understood; the adult immune system must somehow be less optimized to fight off the virus. Halsey points out that this pattern is not unique to measles: Chicken pox and hepatitis A are also milder in children than in adults. So is COVID, as we’ve recently seen.

The consequences of measles can linger long after infection too. Measles has a singular ability to induce “immune amnesia,” making survivors potentially susceptible to other diseases they’ve already had or been vaccinated against. This is because the virus attacks immune cells, including memory B cells, which “remember” how to fight known pathogens through antibodies. A 2019 study found that a course of measles infection in unvaccinated children wrecked 11 to 73 percent of their antibody repertoire. This range suggests that immune amnesia’s impact may vary widely from person to person, but the overall trend explains some old and odd observations about postmeasles immune suppression. For example, measles can make autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks one’s own body, go into remission. Immune amnesia also explains, at least in part, a long-standing pattern of children becoming more vulnerable to other illnesses after getting measles.

This effect has largely been studied in children, so scientists do not really know how it affects adults. “I would anticipate that it would be very similar—and it also might even be slightly worse,” says Stephen Elledge, a biologist at Harvard and senior author on the 2019 immune-amnesia study. A course of measles tends to last longer and be more severe in adults, he reasons, so the disease may kill off more of their memory cells. He suggests that anyone who gets measles should get revaccinated for other diseases, just in case.

If the measles vaccination rate dips further, adult cases could become even more common. The U.S. eliminated measles in 2000, after many years of achieving a better than 95 percent vaccination rate among kindergartners. This number started slipping in 2020 and is now down to 92.7 percent, which is, importantly, edging toward the measles herd-immunity threshold of 92 to 94 percent. Under this threshold, herd immunity can no longer limit spread enough to protect the unvaccinated. A bigger pool of unvaccinated kindergartners means a greater potential for outbreaks that grow massive enough to threaten unvaccinated adults. And if those unvaccinated kids never get their shots later in life, they will become susceptible adults, growing more vulnerable to measles with age.

For now, the Texas outbreak is already so widespread that the U.S. is likely to lose its measles-elimination status. In the time it will take to get this outbreak under control, more children will certainly get infected, as will more adults.

## Trade Will Move On Without the United States

# Trade Will Move On Without the United States

The tariffs will destroy another pillar of American power and leave a vacuum for others to fill.

In his quest to make America great, President Donald Trump is withdrawing the United States from global trade. American families, companies, and investors will pay a price for this, as many commentators have noted. But the repercussions don’t end there. The tariff regime is also destroying a pillar of American global power, and it will further isolate the country at a moment when others stand ready to fill the vacuum.

On Wednesday, Trump announced that America would impose a 10 percent duty on imports from virtually all countries, plus additional punitive tariffs on countries he deems bad actors on trade, including Japan and members of the European Union. Some of these duties are extremely high. Adding the new levies to those previously imposed, China’s average tariff rate is now near 70 percent. Trump described the tariffs as payback: “Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream,” he said. “Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen anymore.”

Trump’s tariffs are the culmination of a decades-long shift in political perceptions in the United States, in which trade has gone from an unalloyed good to the source of all ills. The U.S. once sought to bring down barriers and open markets globally—forging trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and supporting the World Trade Organization. The resulting global trading system lowered the cost of goods, which benefited the companies and consumers of wealthy countries such as the United States. It also connected poorer countries, such as China, to international supply chains, allowing them to create jobs, woo investment, and alleviate poverty. The United States became, in effect, the world’s ultimate consumer, which tied other countries to its economy and its interests.

Annie Lowrey: Here are the places where the recession has already begun

Trade was a glue that held the American-led international order together. But economics always involves trade-offs. As supply chains stretched across the globe in search of lower costs, many factories vanished from the American heartland. Some Americans fastened on trade as the source of the inequality and constrained mobility that plagued the country’s middle and working classes; populist politicians encouraged these sentiments.

Strategically, too, trade’s promise seemed unrealized: Experts and politicians had assured Americans after the Cold War that economic exchange would transform China and Russia into peaceful partners. Within a couple of decades, these powers had clearly become authoritarian competitors instead.

The Trump team sold its tariffs program as a bid to set things straight by forcing America’s lost factories to return home. “You’re going to see the greatest resurgence of factory building and factory production in America,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in defense of the tariffs. Trump is “changing the way people think about production in America.”

The results are unlikely to be what the administration anticipates. Some foreign companies may indeed respond to the tariffs by building factories in the U.S. to maintain their presence in a crucial market. But many others are simply too small, or too integrated into existing supply chains, to make that move. Where the millions of American workers will come from to screw together iPhones or make car parts is also a mystery, especially given the president’s opposition to large-scale immigration. Factories in the U.S. are already struggling to find workers; the manufacturing sector has hundreds of thousands of vacant openings.

Trump has long complained that some other countries tilt trade in their own favor. The White House, in explaining its tariff regime, cited practices by other countries, including currency manipulation and onerous product standards that inhibit imports, that have been real concerns. But the tariff regime may soon lay bare the inconvenient truth of comparative advantage: Certain goods are made outside the U.S. because factories elsewhere can produce them more cheaply and efficiently. Lower costs are a big factor, but so is competence. Many manufacturers in China and elsewhere have developed skills and expertise that make them highly competitive.

The likely outcome of Trump’s policy will be high prices for what Americans make and buy, whether produced at home at greater cost than abroad or imported from overseas with a punitive tax. By one estimate, tariffs could hike the price of a top-end iPhone to $2,300. The Trump team seems to accept this. “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in March. But when consumers buy fewer products at higher prices, companies produce and sell less and hire fewer workers, and growth slows. As French President Emmanuel Macron put it, Trump’s policy will make Americans “weaker and poorer.”

Americans will not be the only ones to suffer in a global trade war. Other countries will likely respond to U.S. tariffs by erecting protectionist barriers of their own. China has already announced an additional 34 percent tariff on U.S. imports. The EU is threatening to retaliate too. The global trade that was once an engine of prosperity may now reverse and become a source of economic competition.

Other countries long accepted U.S. leadership because they saw Washington as a proponent of global economic progress. The role Trump is choosing for the United States is not that. He may eventually roll back tariffs for those countries that negotiate with him, and he may even see this as a show of kingpin-like strength: Trump has already said that he’d be willing to reduce duties on China in return for a deal involving TikTok. But the erratic and arbitrary nature of the policies, and the willingness to exploit U.S. economic might to extort concessions, will undermine American standing nearly everywhere.

Rogé Karma: Trump’s tariffs are designed to backfire

In fact, the administration’s tariff policy opens opportunities for Beijing, of all players, to portray itself as the more responsible global leader. In a meeting just days before Trump’s announcement, ministers from China, Japan, and South Korea issued a statement pledging to promote global trade.

That two of Washington’s closest allies would join Beijing in implicit criticism of the U.S. highlights the danger. The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and a key market for many countries’ exports. But it is not the only game in town, either. A social-media account associated with CCTV, a Chinese state broadcaster, posted a graphic showing the extensive trade agreements that America’s partners have with one another and commented that, with the new tariffs, the U.S. is “shutting itself out of the world of free trade.” These countries will continue to expand their economic ties whatever Trump does. During his first term, after Trump withdrew the U.S. from a major trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, participants completed the pact on their own.

Tariffs are not going to make other countries respect the United States. But they can make them move on without it.

## America Has Gotten Coretta Scott King Wrong

# America Has Gotten Coretta Scott King Wrong


作者:  | 发布时间: April 7, 2025, 7:57 AM ET


Her ghostwritten autobiography diminishes her, and I found out why.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

A year after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, the publishing company Holt, Rinehart and Winston released Coretta Scott King’s My Life With Martin Luther King, Jr. A senior editor at HRW, Charlotte Mayerson, a white woman, had contracted the writer Alden Hatch, also white, for the sizable sum of $15,000 to ghostwrite the book, based on interviews Mayerson had recently completed with Scott King. All of this was “totally confidential,” as the agreement between Hatch and the publisher spelled out, and the book, like the memoirs of many famous people then and now, was presented simply as her autobiography.

I had learned about Hatch in the process of researching Coretta Scott and Martin Luther King Jr.’s life and political partnership for my own book, King of the North: Martin Luther King Jr.’s Life of Struggle Outside the South, and was excited to find that some of the transcripts and audio recordings of those interviews had survived in papers Hatch had donated to the University of Florida. As I listened to one of the recordings, something started to bother me. Scott King didn’t sound the way she did in My Life With Martin Luther King, Jr. The surviving transcripts of the interviews were a chaotic, incomplete mess—but even so, they were quite revealing: The details of Scott King’s ideas were different and more substantive, her perspectives fiercer and more contemplative, than what was portrayed in the book.

And then I found something that explained why—a folder that contained letters between Hatch and Mayerson. When Mayerson sent Hatch the interviews for him to begin ghostwriting the autobiography, she explicitly instructed Hatch that although Scott King talked a “vast amount” about herself and her family background, “it is urgent that the focus of the book be on Martin, not on Coretta.” Despite choosing a white male ghostwriter who did not know Scott King, Mayerson wanted a “very female, personal, and sentimental story” in a “tone that is more like the Reader’s Digest.” Mayerson’s racial blinders shone through—telling Hatch that Scott King had a “certain cold bloodedness in her attitude toward whites.” When Mayerson questioned her about the death of Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, two white Freedom Summer volunteers killed in Mississippi in 1964, she said she was “sad that they died,” but “felt that it was an important event because it made the white community more aware of the problems than any number of Negro deaths would have done.” As I listened to the few recordings and read through the surviving interview transcripts, I noticed how Mayerson interrupted Scott King frequently during the interviews, her incredulity at some of Scott King’s answers coming through clearly.

Months later, as Hatch started to show Scott King draft chapters of the book, both Coretta and her older sister Edythe raised objections to the book’s tone and lack of attention to their family’s work. Hatch was dismissive, telling Mayerson, “I deliberately wrote it with very simple language that I believe would have a special appeal for the critics.” He instructed Mayerson to call in the “big reserves” to intimidate Coretta to acquiesce.

“I am made to sound like an attachment to a vacuum cleaner,” Scott King had observed about the ways she was often represented in public discourse: “the wife of Martin, then the widow of Martin, all of which I was proud to be.” This had even been true in her own “autobiography.” “I didn’t learn my commitment from Martin, we just converged at a certain time.” Although a number of biographers since then have taken note of her politics before she met Martin, she largely disappears as a political actor throughout his life and leadership, until she moves to carry on his legacy after the assassination.

Scott King saw the deficit partly as a result of who was doing the telling. At one of the first conferences of King scholars, in 1986, she said to those gathered, “The next time we have a conference on him, I want to see more women scholars. He allowed me to be myself, and that meant that I always expressed my views.”

Theirs was a political and intellectual partnership from the beginning. King married a feminist intellectual freedom fighter with unflinching determination, and he could not have been the leader he was without her. Scott King’s activism—her understanding of the evils of racism, poverty, and militarism—started before her marriage, complemented and influenced her husband’s work, and extended well beyond his assassination, in 1968. She was the family leader on issues of peace, war, and the economy. Although their relationship hewed to certain gender conventions of the time, particularly because of King’s belief that she be the one to stay home and raise the children, it challenged other dominant social mores. Both refused to “stay in their lane” despite immense pressure; they prioritized a life of struggle over a safe or materially secure family life, she spoke her mind both privately and publicly, and he relied on her thoughts and on her unwavering commitment to keep going.

Coretta was more politically active than Martin when they met. She had grown up in a proud farming family in Alabama who owned their own land. The family was harassed and threatened repeatedly. When her father started transporting lumber, a business reserved for white people, whites torched their house to the ground. And when her father refused to sell his business to a white man, whites burned the business too. Those experiences and the pride that her parents instilled in her helped prepare Coretta for what she would encounter as an adult. Growing up, “I was tough,” and liked to fight, she told Mayerson in 1968—something that didn’t make it into the book.

Her mother was determined that her daughters would get a good education, and sent them to the Lincoln Normal School, in Marion, Alabama. Coretta and Edythe then became the first Black students in decades to attend Antioch College, in Ohio. Coretta majored in music and education and got involved in numerous civil-rights and anti–Cold War efforts. She was introduced to the Progressive Party, which was created to challenge both the Democrats and Republicans on U.S. segregation and Cold War militarism. In 1948, she supported Henry Wallace for president, and attended the Progressive Party Convention in Philadelphia as a student delegate (one of about 150 African Americans at the convention). Through her Progressive Party activities, she met both the singer Paul Robeson and the activist Bayard Rustin, and heard the playwright and activist Shirley Graham (who would marry W. E. B. Du Bois three years later) give a powerful speech.

Seeking to pursue a music career, Coretta moved to Boston to attend the New England Conservatory of Music. There, through a friend, she met Martin, who was getting his doctorate at Boston University, in January 1952. They talked about racism and capitalism on their first date. Martin was smitten; he’d never met a woman like her. At the end of that date, he told her she had “all the qualities he wanted in a wife—beauty, personality, character, and intelligence.” She was incredulous, telling him, “You don’t even know me.” But she agreed to another date. She was impressed with his vision and determination to change the country. And Martin was a good listener; he didn’t judge. Their romance blossomed. Still, she worried that becoming a minister’s wife would make her life small. It took her many months to decide whether to marry him. When they did wed, in June 1953, she refused to wear white and made her imposing father-in-law take “obey” out of their vows, because it made her feel “like an indentured servant.” She would keep Scott as her middle name, which she then always used, becoming Coretta Scott King for the rest of her life, unlike many women of her generation. Many journalists and public officials would refuse to recognize that, referring to her only as “Mrs. Martin Luther King.”

Coretta’s steadfastness came out early. Seven weeks into the Montgomery bus boycott, on January 30, 1956, the Kings’ home was bombed. Both Coretta and their two-month-old baby, Yolanda, were home. Hearing a thump, she moved fast, succeeding in getting them out unscathed. Furious and terrified by the news, both Martin’s and Coretta’s fathers came to Montgomery to tell them to leave immediately—or, at the very least, to get Coretta and Yolanda out of there. The pressure was immense. “I knew I wasn’t going anywhere,” Coretta recalled in a 1966 interview with New Lady magazine. The next morning at breakfast, Martin was grateful: “You were the only one who stood with me.” Had she flinched in that moment, as I wrote for this magazine in 2018, the trajectory of the bus boycott and Martin’s emerging leadership could have been very different.

From that night on, they lived with the understanding that if they continued in the struggle, she too might be killed. Martin had to reckon with the possibility of Coretta’s death, just as she had to reckon with his. When he grew frightened, she would remind him that the movement was bigger than they were. In key ways, the Kings were forging a way of family life and leadership different from that of many of their generation and their parents, by rejecting the “promise of protection” that good men were supposed to provide and prioritizing a life of freedom fighting instead.

Martin came to rely on Coretta’s unflinching steeliness. The one time she broke down terrified him. In 1960, King was arrested at an Atlanta sit-in; when the others were released, the state dredged up an old traffic charge to keep him, transferring him hundreds of miles in the middle of the night, his hands shackled to the police-car floor. He thought he was going to be killed. Then, when the judge sentenced him to four months’ hard labor, Coretta, frightened, exhausted, and six months pregnant, started crying. Martin was shaken: “Corrie, I’ve never seen you like this; you have to stand up for me.” In many ways, he relied on her strength.

In her own activism, Scott King came to zero in on global peace and anti-colonialism. In 1962, when their third son, Dexter, was not even 2 years old, she joined a Women Strike for Peace delegation for a multination disarmament conference in Geneva, Switzerland, to pressure the United States and the Soviet Union to sign a nuclear-test-ban treaty. As Scott King told the press, “The rights that we had achieved were meaningless unless there was a world to exercise those rights.” The punishing climate of the Cold War—in which people were slandered for their political beliefs, called “un-American,” and in some cases even fired from their job—led many people, both Black and white, including many activists the Kings knew, to stay away from such global politics. But Scott King pushed forward, the Geneva trip deepening her global commitments. In 1963, she led a march to the United Nations carrying a sign saying Let’s Make Our Earth a Nuclear-Free Zone, where a delegation met with UN Secretary-General U Thant. Scott King then left New York City for another Women Strike for Peace action in Washington, D.C., telling the press she was proud to be identified with the peace movement. “I can never be free until every black man from Johannesburg, South Africa, to Jackson, Mississippi, is free.”

After King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, she saw a heightened responsibility for both of them to the global community, as My Life With Martin Luther King, Jr. notes. She spoke out against U.S. involvement in Vietnam and became “the family spokesperson on the peace issues,” though the book gives this part of her life very scant treatment. One reporter pushed King on how he had found such a political companion; had he trained her in this direction? King laughed and then responded, “It may have been the other way around. When I met her, she was very concerned with all the things we are trying to do now … I wish I could say to satisfy my masculine ego that I led her down this path but I must say we went down together.”

Scott King tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1965 to take a stand on Vietnam. At an SCLC retreat in early 1965, she explained how the war drains “resources from education, housing, health, and other badly needed programs,” making clear to those gathered, “why do you think we got the Nobel Prize? … Peace and justice are indivisible.” She understood that they had gotten the award, and thus the responsibilities demanded of them around racism, poverty, and militarism.

To be a peace activist in 1965 was to be seen as un-American, but Scott King was “beyond steel,” as a fellow activist noted. In May 1965, bucking Cold War pressure, she addressed the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom conference on the topic of “Peace, Jobs, and Freedom,” and then in June she spoke before a crowd of 18,000 at the Emergency Rally on Vietnam, in Madison Square Garden. For this work, in March 1966, the FBI put her in a category of “subversives.”

In September 1965, after a meeting at the UN, King denounced the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam. President Lyndon B. Johnson was furious. Congressmen questioned King’s patriotism, and newspapers editorialized against him. Feeling the pressure, in November, he backed out of an address to a D.C. peace rally, but Scott King kept her commitment and spoke. Addressing the 25,000 gathered, she underlined that “unless America learns to respect the right to freedom and justice for all, then the very things which we hold dear in this country will wither away in the hypocritical ritual of the preservation of national self-interest.” Following her appearance, a reporter asked King if he had educated his wife on these issues. “She educated me,” he replied. In fall 1966, Scott King joined the steering committee of what became the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam. She was leading not just her husband on this issue, but the nation. King would make his historic anti-war speech from Riverside Church on April 4, 1967.

In the last six months of his life, King turned to building the Poor People’s Campaign. Although many in the SCLC balked, Scott King was already on board. The idea for the PPC was that a multiracial army of people from across the nation, drawing from local groups across the country, would descend on D.C. and stay there to force Congress to “see the poor” and act. Just weeks after King was assassinated, Scott King continued that work, kicking off the PPC from the Memphis balcony where he had been killed. At a Mother’s Day march of welfare recipients in D.C. the following week, she highlighted the violence of U.S. political priorities. “Neglecting schoolchildren is violence. Punishing a mother and her family is violence … Ignoring medical needs is violence. Contempt for poverty is violence. Even the lack of willpower to help humanity is a sick and sinister form of violence.”

Scott King’s story is a reminder that many of the histories we tell, even of one of the most well-known Black families in history, are deeply inadequate. “I keep seeing these books that come out, and there are so many inaccuracies,” Scott King herself observed in a 2004 interview. “And that becomes history if you don’t correct it.” America needs the true story of its history, and part of that story was the bold, brilliant advocacy of Coretta Scott King.

Towns near the Canadian border are suffering.

Last month, Nicholas Gilbert received a delivery of grain for the 1,400 cows he tends at his dairy farm in Potsdam, New York, 20 miles from the Ontario border. The feed came with a surprise tariff of $2,200 tacked on. “We have small margins,” he told me. “I had a contracted price on that grain delivered to my barn. It was supposed to be so much per ton. And they added that tariff right on top because it comes from a Canadian feed mill.”

Gilbert cannot increase the price of the milk he sells, which is set by the local co-op. He cannot feed his cows less food. He cannot buy feed from another supplier; there aren’t any nearby, and getting it from farther away would be more expensive. When he got the delivery, he stared at the tariff for a while. Shouldn’t his Canadian supplier have been responsible for paying it? “I’m not even sure it’s legal! We contracted for the price on delivery! If your price of fuel goes up or your truck breaks down, that’s not my problem! That’s what the contract’s for.”

But the tariff was legal, and it was Gilbert’s responsibility. The dairy farmer is one of tens of thousands of American business owners caught in a spiraling trade war, and lives in one area of the United States that might already be tipping into a recession because of it. Businesses near the Canadian border are particularly vulnerable to the rising costs and falling revenue caused by tariffs, and are delaying projects, holding off on hiring, raising prices, letting workers go, or wondering how they are going to keep feeding their cows as a result.

President Donald Trump kicked off his long-promised trade war by applying levies to steel, aluminum, and goods from China, Canada, and Mexico soon after he took office—insisting, incorrectly, that foreign companies would pay the tariffs and that American growth would surge. On Wednesday, he unleashed a global shock-and-awe campaign, announcing tariffs on every American trading partner.

Rogé Karma: Trump’s most inexplicable decision yet

The measures are meant to counter foreign countries’ tariffs and trade barriers, Trump said. But the numbers announced have nothing to do with such policies, where they even exist. The White House set a minimum 10 percent levy on imports from around the world, and imposed higher rates on imports from more than 60 countries, territories, and trading blocs. The administration appears to have derived those higher rates by dividing the value of the country’s bilateral trade deficit with the United States by the value of its exports to the United States.

The tariffs are capricious, haphazard, and weird. The Trump administration took into account only trade in goods, not services. It slapped tariffs on countries with long-standing free-trade agreements with Washington, including Australia, South Korea, Israel, Panama, Singapore, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. It put tariffs on countries with a trade surplus with the United States. It implemented tariffs on remote, uninhabited islands. It implemented tariffs on a territory occupied predominantly by American and British soldiers.

The nonsensical policy will nevertheless have real effects. American consumer goods will get more expensive, with the average family paying an estimated $3,800 more a year for groceries, cars, clothing, furniture, and everything else if the tariff rates remain this high. Thousands of American firms, mostly small businesses, will go under. The United States risks collapsing into an astonishing voluntary recession, caused solely by a few powerful ideologues’ erroneous beliefs about trade.

If you want to understand where the American economy is heading, head to the border.

From Bellingham, Washington, to Calais, Maine, the United States has dozens of communities that are not so much linked to Canada’s economy as interwoven with it. Gas stations in these places rely on business from Canadian commuters. Ski resorts and water parks rely on Canadian tourists. Manufacturing firms rely on Canadian industrial inputs. Farms rely on Canadian feed. Hotels rely on Canadian business conferences.

Annie Lowrey: Don’t invite a recession in

Contrary to Trump’s pronouncements, tariffs are paid by domestic importers, not foreign exporters. Most companies pass the cost increase on to consumers. Others, like Adon Farms, cannot. “We’re taking that right on the chin,” Gilbert told me, explaining that he would have to pay tariffs on the fertilizer and farm equipment he buys too. “We’re not like other businesses,” he told me. “We’re very slow moving. I can’t pivot at all.”

Manufacturing firms and construction companies near the border face the same quandaries as the costs of steel, aluminum, lumber, and machine parts rise. These firms can’t quickly relocate their operations or find new suppliers either. “We surveyed 40 of our manufacturing companies in the region,” Garry Douglas, of New York’s North Country Chamber of Commerce, told me. “One sources raw materials from Canada and is looking at a $16 million cost increase to their U.S. operation. Another company is a paper mill that sources wood pulp from Canada. It’s the one source of the type of wood they need.”

At the same time as it is raising costs for border businesses, Trump’s quixotic trade war with Canada is depressing revenue for these businesses too. Dan Kelleher runs a tourism-promotion agency in the Adirondacks. “We had a terrific January in terms of overall visitation,” he told me. “Our numbers were up 24 percent over the five-year average. And then February came.” The president kept referring to Canada as the “51st state,” and hit the United States’ closest ally with a 25 percent tariff. Spending on lodging dropped 4 percent in February, Kelleher told me, with retailers reporting a 20 percent decline in sales.

“We have a lot of cross-border events, particularly hockey tournaments,” Kelleher said. “The teams are locked in to come play, but when they come, they’re not spending any money here.” He worried about the summer tourist season, and more so about the relationship between residents of the Adirondacks and their neighbors across the border. “Our Canadian friends—they’re upset, they’re hurt, they’re betrayed.”

Ron Kurnik is a dual citizen who lives in Canada and commutes across the border to run Superior Coffee Roasting, a café and coffee distributor in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. “One of our premier labels is an espresso blend, which I aptly termed the friendly neighbors,” he told me. “We spell it both ways on the label, neighbors and neighbours. It’s been the centerpiece of our business, and our relationship with the residents of this area.”

Rogé Karma: Trump’s tariffs are designed to backfire

Kurnik imports his coffee beans from Mexico and his coffee bags from China; both are more expensive, thanks to Trump’s levies. “With the added tax, we’re currently underwater on distribution,” he told me. With fewer Canadians crossing the Saint Marys River, sales at his café have dropped too. Superior Coffee Roasting has a “bit of a war chest,” in the form of profits from last year, Kurnik said. “That will probably, probably, get us through this year.” But he’s cut back on employee hours and laid one person off. “I’m trying to hold the line and not make too many big, consequential decisions,” he said. “If these things continue for six, eight months or beyond, it’s going to get bad.”

Residents of border towns see their shopping malls and greasy spoons half empty. They read stories in the local paper about rising construction costs and Canadians detained at border crossings. They notice the lack of hiring signs. They hear about the trade war on the evening news. As a result, many are reducing their own spending in expectation of a downturn: putting off home repairs, delaying the purchase of a new car, canceling vacations, eating in instead of ordering out.

“It is definitely having a rippling effect, and it’s been immediate,” says Michael Cashman, the supervisor of the town of Plattsburgh, New York, 20 minutes south of the border. “These may seem like small trade restrictions in Washington. But they’re devastating for our region.” He told me he was “deeply concerned” about sales-tax revenue dropping. Plattsburgh is preparing to pull back on public spending “until there is more clarity in the forecast.” Of course, the town cutting its budget would worsen the downturn.

What is happening in Plattsburgh and Sault Ste. Marie is happening in rural Nebraska, Kentucky’s bourbon country, and Las Vegas too—in every community that relies on foreign tourists, foreign imports, foreign exports, and cross-border traffic. Now, Trump’s new policies have put the whole country at risk. I surveyed my inbox the morning after the president’s Liberation Day announcement, reading market analysts’ notes: a “self-inflicted economic catastrophe,” a “large headwind,” a “transformed outlook,” “unconditionally bad,” an “extended period of volatility,” a “historic shift,” “madness.”

In Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, Kurnik was penciling out numbers on Wednesday—when retailers might raise prices for a bag of beans, how much to slow down production—while Trump was preparing for his speech in the Rose Garden. “We can’t operate a business flying by the seat of our pants,” he told me. “The administration can organize itself in that fashion. But how do you realistically expect me to follow suit?”

Putin’s Russia shows what happens when billionaire businessmen choose to back a strongman.

When tech billionaires and crypto moguls hailed Donald Trump’s reelection and flocked to his inauguration ceremony and ball, million-dollar donations in hand, some were abandoning previous liberal affiliations and all were now lining up behind an openly authoritarian president. The surface rationale is that megabusiness leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and Marc Andreessen are safeguarding their companies and their shareholders’ interests. The underlying explanation is that America is being reborn as an oligarchy.

This new class—with Trump megadonor Elon Musk as its self-appointed tribune—has thrown its support behind a libertarian economic agenda that maximizes private power and minimizes public accountability. Whether the billionaires’ alignment with Trump and Musk is merely pragmatic or sincerely ideological, they stand to gain from the new administration’s crash program of dismantling government and regulatory agencies. For Trump, allying with such concentrated economic power helps him consolidate political control, at the expense of democracy. This fusion of money and power is nothing new. I saw something similar take shape in my native Russia. But three decades later, the Russian oligarchs’ bargain has ended up with only one true beneficiary: Vladimir Putin.

America’s billionaires should take note. When extreme wealth combines forces with extreme power, the former can profit enormously for a time. As in Russia, the benefits of the executive’s policies are likely to flow upward: Super-wealthy Americans will enjoy tax breaks and deregulation for their businesses, while the poor will face rising prices, shrinking services, and reduced opportunity. But America’s tech oligarchs may discover sooner rather than later that, by undermining democratic governance, they are empowering an authoritarian president who can pick them off one by one—just as Putin did with the oligarchs who helped cement his rule.

Anne Applebaum: America’s future is Hungary

When Communism collapsed in 1991 and Russia pivoted to capitalism, the country’s wealth quickly ended up in the hands of a few newly minted businessmen. A mix of small-time entrepreneurs, opportunistic academics, mid-level functionaries, and shady characters with ties to organized crime, these men affiliated themselves with Boris Yeltsin’s post-Soviet government. By arranging loans for Yeltsin’s floundering administration in return for stakes in privatized industries, they profited directly from the fire sale of state assets.

Among the most prominent of these oligarchs, as they became known, were Boris Berezovsky, a mathematician turned media mogul; Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former Komsomol activist who became the owner of the oil-and-gas giant Yukos; and Vladimir Gusinsky, a theater-academy graduate who leveraged his ties to Moscow’s elite to build a banking, real-estate, and media empire. While these businessmen rode around in bulletproof limousines and dropped $10,000 a bottle on champagne at ritzy new nightclubs, the rest of the country—already reeling from the Washington Consensus–inspired shock therapy that dismantled price controls, triggering hyperinflation—watched their savings vanish and sank deeper into poverty.

By the 1996 election, resentment of the Yeltsin circle’s insider deals was so great that the Communist Party, in disgrace five years earlier, staged a comeback that saw its candidate compete in a runoff with Yeltsin. Into this chaotic scene came Putin, a former KGB officer who joined the Yeltsin administration that year and became its security chief in 1998. In 1999, Putin was appointed prime minister; in 2000, after Yeltsin’s resignation, he was elected president.

The oligarchs had sponsored his rise as a dependable apparatchik who would instill order and protect their state-asset acquisitions. They misjudged him: Barely a month after his inauguration, Putin reversed the master-servant hierarchy. In June, Gusinsky was arrested on corruption charges and pressured into relinquishing control of his media holdings to the state-owned Gazprom in exchange for his release. Soon after, Berezovsky fled the country when confronted with similar tactics. Both men were accused of fraud and embezzlement. Russia’s top law-enforcement officer, the prosecutor general, is—like the attorney general in the United States—a presidential nominee. These prosecutions were widely seen as politically motivated.

Putin had sent a message: The oligarchs could keep their wealth as long as they obeyed his dictates and stayed out of politics. These moves met no resistance in the courts or from the Duma, Russia’s parliament. Instead, lawmakers immediately granted the president additional powers that enabled him to weaken Russian federalism—dismantling the autonomy that local elites had enjoyed under Yeltsin—and to centralize power in the Kremlin.

Superficially, Putin’s action looked like a renationalization of state assets. In practice, it was a wealth transfer to loyalists and security-service allies. This process culminated in the 2003 takeover of Yukos. Khodorkovsky, then the richest man in Russia and a notable backer of Western-style liberal democracy, was jailed. Yukos’s assets were first frozen and then sold off at auction. The main chunk went to the state-controlled Rosneft corporation, which was led by another former KGB officer, the Putin confidant Igor Sechin. Khodorkovsky’s lawyers faced retaliation for representing their client against the government prosecution.

With that, Putin had ended Russia’s brief experiment in liberalization. Now he set about reshaping the political architecture of post-Soviet Russia.

The horrific 2004 Beslan hostage crisis, when a school siege by Chechen separatists ended in a botched rescue by Russian forces and hundreds of civilian deaths, gave him his opportunity. Under the pretext of fighting terrorism, Putin abolished direct elections for provincial governors and installed Kremlin appointees. He used administrative means to suppress political opponents: Candidates seeking office faced burdensome signature requirements, registration denials, or disqualification on technicalities. Serious challengers such as Alexei Navalny faced trumped-up charges of embezzlement and fraud.

Putin also moved to crush Russia’s free press by revoking licenses for independent media, forcing ownership changes, and installing editorial teams that would stick to Kremlin-approved narratives. With a series of laws, Putin escalated measures against foreign NGOs, criminalizing their activity and cutting funding for human-rights work in Russia.

In a charade of compliance with presidential term limits, Putin stood down in 2008, serving as prime minister under his protégé, President Dmitry Medvedev. Exploiting a constitutional loophole that barred only consecutive terms, Putin returned to the presidency in 2012—and then secured an amendment in 2020 that reset his term count and will allow him to remain in office until 2036. After public demonstrations against election fraud in 2011 and 2012, his government imposed harsh penalties for “unauthorized protests”; today, even a single person with a placard violates the law.

The Russian Orthodox Church has been a major sponsor of Putin’s regime. The Church’s head since 2009 has been Patriarch Kirill, an ultra-wealthy oligarch in his own right, with a fortune estimated at $4 billion. Declaring Putin’s leadership “a miracle of God” in 2012, the patriarch has provided important ideological buttressing for Putin, reframing his neo-imperialist project as a metaphysical struggle against forces opposing the “Russian world” (a Völkisch concept encompassing any territory with a Russian-speaking population). Under Putin, Orthodox priests have become regular fixtures in schools, at official ceremonies such as rocket launches, and at the front in Ukraine.

Wrapped in the Russian flag and carrying an Orthodox cross, Putin has gone about making Russia great again—with the help of his obedient oligarchs. When Russia seized Crimea, in 2014, his closest allies took a cut of Ukrainian assets: Arkady Rotenberg, the president’s former judo partner, acquired confiscated land and was awarded a $3.6 billion contract to build the Crimea Bridge. By Putin’s fifth-term reelection last year, the business elite had little choice but to back his “special military operation” in Ukraine: The oligarchs’ collaboration successfully shielded them from U.S. and European sanctions, and the combined wealth of Russia’s 10 richest billionaires has grown since 2023. But there’s a catch: Even the oligarchs live in terror. Among the numerous Russian businessmen to have suffered a fatal fall from a window in recent years was Ravil Maganov, the chairman of Lukoil, after his company called for an end to the war in Ukraine.

Read: Trump gets a taste of Putin’s tactics

Putin’s regime offers a stark illustration of how democratic institutions can be hollowed out. Some of Trump’s recent moves contain echoes of Kremlin strategy: canceling institutional checks in favor of loyalist appointments, attacking lawyers who work for opponents, demolishing independent agencies, feeding popular delusions of imperial greatness by threatening neighbors. The reforms of Musk’s DOGE outfit are set to shift public goods into private hands.

America is not Russia, and no billionaires are falling from windows here. The U.S. economy remains far more diverse and dynamic, and far larger, than Russia’s, but its competitive edge is already challenged by China, a threat that Trump’s tariff policy is unlikely to offset. America’s competitive advantages may start to erode under the new administration’s war on science and education. That already happened in Russia: Once a scientific and cultural powerhouse, the country is now a rigid petrostate. Over the past two decades, Russia’s scientific community has contracted by about 25 percent, thanks to declining educational standards and a brain drain of self-exiled talent.

An authoritarian oligarchy is not a pleasant place to live in. Ask my 88-year-old aunt, who was hit by a car in a provincial Russian town some years ago and can no longer leave her apartment because of the long-term injuries she sustained. After the case was investigated, she was pressured to withdraw her testimony because the driver was the son of a local official. That is how Putin’s “power vertical,” as Russian political parlance refers to his highly centralized, top-down authority, reaches into the lives of the little people. The oligarchy’s erosion of the rule of law trickles down, corroding public trust and ultimately leaving everyone—elites and ordinary citizens alike—at the mercy of arbitrary absolutism. The billionaire class now rallying behind Trump would do well to consider the implications of such a partnership.

For now, America still has a functioning electoral system, democratic institutions that have endured for centuries rather than decades, and a diverse, vibrant civil society. It also holds a vision of itself, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, in which everyone has the right to pursue a fulfilling and self-determined life. But as Putin showed, constitutions can be amended or worked around; Trump is already musing about a third term. To follow Russia’s cynical path—whereby an all-powerful ruler feeds the masses false promises of greatness and keeps the oligarchs in line with favors and threats—would be to lose sight of that vision.

# How to Defy Death

Does biohacking actually work?

Humans have always tried to prolong life and battle mortality, but what do the current influx of biohackers reveal about this era of individual responsibility?

Timothy Caulfield, a professor and the research director at the Health Law Institute at the University of Alberta, studies how health and science are represented in the public sphere. The lines between wellness culture, longevity, and biohacking are beginning to blur, and Caulfield offers advice about how to dodge misinformation and unproven theories while still pursuing a long and meaningful life.

How do you think about aging? Please leave us a voicemail (202-266-7701) with your name, your age, and answers to the following questions:

- What aspects of aging are you nervous about?
- What are you looking forward to as you age?
- Who do you hope to be like when you are older? Is there someone in your life who has made you excited to get older?

Leaving a voicemail means that you are consenting to the possibility of The Atlantic using your audio in a future episode of How To.

The following is a transcript:

Natalie Brennan: Do you want to live forever?

[Music.]

Yasmin Tayag: Hell no. Absolutely not. Of course I want to live, like, a long and healthy and happy life. I would love to live to, like, 90. You know, enjoy the time with my family and friends. But, like, thinking about how tired I am now at 37, I’m like—can you imagine how exhausted you’d be at 100, 150?

Brennan: I don’t want to live forever, but I’m really scared of death. I mean, it’s kind of the one thing we really don’t know anything about, right? And I feel like I want to get to the bottom of everything. I want the answers. And that’s one we don’t get answers about.

Tayag: Maybe that’s why we’re so tired.

Brennan: Exhausted. I’m exhausted.

Tayag: I’m Yasmin Tayag, a staff writer with The Atlantic.

Brennan: And I’m Natalie Brennan, producer at The Atlantic.

Tasmin: This is How to Age Up.

[Music.]

Brennan: Yasmin, you’ve been reporting on science, health, culture, for the last, what—decade?

Tayag: It’s been a decade.

Brennan: From your perspective, does this current moment of longevity culture feel different to you, or is this just, you know, humans have always been obsessed with figuring out how to defy death?

Tayag: I would say that we could look at any decade, even any century, and see that there were health trends that were prominent. In the 1700s, people were doing bloodletting: literally cutting open a vein to let a couple ounces of blood out. Because they thought that’s how you would get rid of illness in the body and be healthier. And 200 years later, John Harvey Kellogg, the cereal guy—he was basically, like, the TikTok wellness influencer of the time, and he was promoting things like electric-light bathing.

Brennan: What’s that?

Tayag: It’s lying in a box surrounded by lights. And he said this would cure basically any ailment.

Brennan: I’d give it a try. [Laughter.]

Tayag: Kellogg also pushed things like three-gallon enemas.

Brennan: Whoa.

Tayag: Because he was very into the idea of cleansing your insides and outsides to be healthy. And people loved this stuff. Like, he had this spa where he would offer these treatments, and so many people went.

Brennan: I think one thing that’s really interesting to me is: As this wellness culture was becoming quite popularized in the 18th century, it’s almost at the same time in which enlightenment is becoming the more dominant theory that’s beginning to challenge religion. And so much of wellness culture today—to me—again feels like it is trying to be the central organizing principle in our lives that, you know, maybe religion used to take the place of.

Tayag: You know, I think what religion offers people is a set of instructions for living your life. Yeah. And so if that’s not being passed down by God, you gotta find it somewhere else. And maybe the particular flavor of wellness right now tells us a lot about where we are culturally.

Brennan: I think that’s right. We have an administration that’s looking to prioritize or politicize “health” as a main tenet of its policy. There’s a growing culture of people who are undergoing very extreme measures to live longer.

[Music.]

Tayag: Yeah, and also it seems like every day I’m marketed a different supplement promising to improve me somehow.

Brennan: And I think the big question I have, though, is Improve … what? What are we really trying to address or fix?

Timothy Caulfield: And there’s this idea that if you’re not doing this, there’s something wrong with you. Like it’s a noble pursuit, right? It’s a noble pursuit; it’s a righteous movement.

Timothy Caulfield: And there’s this idea that if you’re not doing this, there’s something wrong with you. Like it’s a noble pursuit, right? It’s a noble pursuit; it’s a righteous movement.

Tayag: So Natalie, that’s Timothy Caulfield. He’s a professor and the research director at the Health Law Institute at the University of Alberta. He and his research team look at the ways that health and science are represented in the public sphere—from product labels to misinformation and the promotion of unproven theories on social media. And we talked about the ways wellness culture, longevity, and especially biohacking are beginning to blur.

[Music.]

Caulfield: Well, I think that’s a term that has taken on different lives, too. You know, when I first started exploring biohacking, it was very much this idea of putting a microchip in your body, or, you know, doing something kind of physical—using technology and merging it with the human body. I think biohacking now has morphed into the idea of … it includes that stuff, but it also includes using some kind of technique or procedure or supplement in order to optimize yourself. And I think in some ways, there has been a pivot from wellness and, you know, the alternative-medicine universe, to the language of longevity. And I think it’s been a shift from kind of other ways of knowing, and perhaps culturally different ways to approach health, to the science-y kind of language of longevity. And the reality is: It’s all the same noise being repackaged as longevity.

Tayag: So could you give me an example of one or two specific forms of biohacking that have become popular?

Caulfield: The cold plunge now has become really common; you hear influencers talking about [it]. It’s very common in the manosphere—that masculine online-influencer space. A cold plunge is a pretty extreme activity, right? And you might be doing it with a community of individuals, right? Which, you know, can make it fun, and make it feel like it has a little bit more validity to it. And look, there are some studies that hint that it might have an impact on your immune system—and these are very preliminary—but the reality is, there is no good evidence to suggest that cold plunges are going to have a dramatic impact on your health. And certainly there’s no evidence to suggest it’s going to help you live longer. And I think we see that a lot in the biohacking longevity space. Sort of a misrepresentation of the complexity and nuance of the actual relevant research. Supplements are another, I think, really, really common biohacking tool that we’re seeing now. And again, the supplement industry is absolutely massive. You know, it’s a multibillion-dollar industry that is built on a foundation of very sketchy, questionable science, very, uh, light regulation. And yeah; look, I want to be really careful. Major caveat here: If you go to a science-informed clinician, and they tell you how you have a specific deficiency, that’s different from the messaging that is emanating about supplements from the longevity industry. So I think those are two really common examples.

Tayag: I mean, I have to admit: I have given into the cold plunge! I was skeptical going in, but I really enjoyed it! I felt amazing after.

Caulfield: And I don’t want to dismiss that, right? If people do find that, you know, invigorating, that’s a thing—you know, that’s a thing that’s not to be dismissed. But the promise here is actual sort of biological change, right, that is going to have a measurable impact on how long you live—and we just don’t have good studies to back that up.

Tayag: So what’s an example of a biohacking practice that did have evidence behind it, but might still be problematic?

Caulfield: There have been examples of extreme diets. You’re probably familiar with the intermittent-fasting trend, right? And that’s a fascinating story. There’ve been interesting animal studies, and even sort of studies with humans that have suggested that it might promote longevity. The problem is, it can also, I think, promote disordered eating, right? Short term, like so many diets, they have helped people lose weight. But it’s hard to maintain an extreme diet—there’s really strong evidence to support this. The best diet, okay, is the diet that’s healthy, sustainable, and works for you. That’s the best diet, right? A healthy diet is one that is healthy, sustainable, and works for you. And that often means something that you enjoy.

Brennan: I have to admit, I love a cold plunge.

Tayag: [Laughter.] Really?

Brennan: I love a cold plunge. I guess what I mean is: I love to jump into cold water.

Tayag: Where do you do this?

Brennan: Anywhere I could jump into cold. If I could jump in the East River, I’d be swimming in it.

Tayag: Please never do that.

Brennan: I will never do that. On New Year’s Day this year, I was at my best friend’s house in L.A., and her parents have a pool. And it was filled, even though it was January. It’s not heated. And I was like, “It’s New Year’s Day; I need to cleanse.” And we jumped in together. And it was the just sweetest moment of my year so far, honestly. I felt amazing for the rest of the day. I can appreciate a lot of the factors there are just: I’m with my best friend, and it’s a special day. And as somebody who spends a ton of time in my own head, water is a thing that really brings me into my body.

Tayag: Yeah, and the jolt of cold shocks all the thoughts out of you.

Brennan: But I’m interested in this idea about the placebo effect. In 1955, a researcher named Henry Beecher published an influential paper called “The Powerful Placebo,” and its findings were debated for decades. But now there’s wider scientific consensus that the placebo effect is real.

So, in a classic placebo-effect trial, the control group wouldn’t know that they’re the control group, right? So let’s say one group is given a real medication, and the other is given a placebo pill, and neither group knows which trial they’re a part of.

But, there was a study by Harvard Medical School that found that the placebo effect was up to 50 percent as effective as real drugs.

Tayag: Big.

Brennan: Huge. And they tested by giving one group a migraine drug labeled with the drug’s name.

Tayag: Mmhmm.

Brennan: And another group took a placebo that was labeled placebo.

Tayag: Oh, they knew.

Brennan: They knew they were getting the placebo. Which may indicate that knowing you’re being subject to a placebo doesn’t ruin the effects. Which is all to say, to all listeners who are worried that we just ruined cold plunges for them: enjoy.

Tayag: Yeah, you know: If you believe it’s gonna make you feel awesome, it will! Maybe it will.

Brennan: It maybe will.

Tayag: But I think, you know, what I would like to see is to reframe these practices. If you love being at your friend’s house and jumping into a cold pool on New Year’s Day, like—do that, absolutely. But don’t believe that it’s going to make you live longer or be healthier. It might make you happier. It might make you happier, and, you know, that’s important too.

Brennan: Doing things that make you happy, be in community, create joy are good for your health, right? But the promise that we’re being sold—that all of these very specific practices are the key to living longer? That one we need to analyze a bit.

[Music.]

Tayag: Tim, we’ve been talking a lot about how biohacks are promoted as science-based even when they aren’t necessarily. So I’m curious: What is the larger impact that has on the public understanding of science more broadly?

Caulfield: We’ve actually done a lot of research on this. I call it science-ploitation. So, you take real science—exciting science, often—science that has gotten a lot of attention in the popular press and in the information environment more broadly. And you take the language of that science in order to push misinformation or questionable therapies. One of the best examples of that: the stem-cell space. I’ve worked in this space right from the beginning, from the late ’90s forward. I’ve been very closely connected to the stem-cell-research community. It is a genuinely exciting area of research, and there was a moment when it was the most … like, it was “headlines” kind of research field. It was controversial because it involved embryo research. And because of that, we got a lot of hyped language about the value and the potential for stem cells to revolutionize health care. That language—and, by the way, that was hype. And probably not justified given how complex science … science is hard, right?

Tayag: Science is hard. Stem cells—I still have to explain stem cells every time I mention them in an article.

Caulfield: It’s hard. It remains exciting, right? It remains exciting. But that language, the stem-cell language, has migrated to pop culture, and it’s everywhere.  The words stem cell: it’s on facial cream. It’s on beauty products more broadly. It’s on shampoo. A bottle might say “contains apple stem cells” or “contains organic, all-natural stem cells.” And we know research also tells us that using sciencey language like stem cells does create a veneer of legitimacy. It does make it seem more believable, even if the use of the word doesn’t fit with the product. And of course, what’s really happening there is they’re trying to leverage the genuine and justified excitement about a real field of research in order to give their product a veneer of scientific legitimacy. We’ve seen it happen with precision medicine. Everything’s personalized now. And it works. And holy cow; it really is happening in the longevity space, right? Because these are individuals that want to lean into the cutting edge. They want to lean into things that are sort of in front of the curve. And so, therefore, it makes it more enticing; it makes it seem more legitimate, it makes it seem like they’re doing the best they possibly can to live longer. And science-ploitation, as I call it, has become a very, very common marketing ploy. In fact, I think it’s almost universal now. If there’s a health or a nutritional product, there’s almost some degree of science-ploitation associated with it.

Tayag: Well, you know, with science-ploitation so rampant, how is the average consumer—who is maybe not super well-versed in how to assess the value of a study—you know, how are they supposed to make sense of all of this? If you see a face cream that says “stem cells will renew your skin,” how do you know if that’s real or not?

Caulfield: Assume nothing works. I once pitched a book called Nothing Works. And the editors were like, “Okay, that’s a little dark,” but you can almost do that. If there was some kind of revolutionary new approach to doing something, I promise, we would know. There would just be this broad acceptance of it, right? And for most of the things that we want to improve our life, you know: We know the answer. There really are very few, if any, magical answers.

Tayag: Let’s remind people what works. What are those things that we should know and not take for granted?

Caulfield: You don’t smoke. You exercise, you know—move, just move. Do what you love, whether that’s flipping tires or dancing or walking; just do something you love, right? You eat healthy. You sleep. You take the logical preventative steps, right—you wear a seatbelt, you get vaccinated. You drink less alcohol, right? Less is best. And you surround yourself with people you love, and you have a good community. That’s it, right? Oh, oh, the very most important thing you need to do: Pick the right parents, right? Make sure you have the right parents, because that speaks to the genetic-luck component to it—but more importantly, unfortunately, it speaks to socioeconomics, it speaks to equity, it speaks to the injustices that permeate our societies that really have an impact on how long you’re going to live. Everything else you do, everything else you do at best is nibbling at the edges, and might be even hurting those other things.

Tayag: Do you have any advice for people who are trying to understand the research? Like, they really want to figure out: Is this real interesting new science, or is it just science-ploitation?

Caulfield: Never fall for what’s often called the “single-study syndrome.” Right? So if it’s one study that sort of counters a body of evidence, that’s interesting. But always remember: You have to generally be patient and wait for the science to evolve, wait for a body of evidence to emerge, and always remember that science is hard and it takes a very long time to go from an animal study to a clinical study to actually being in the clinic or being, you know, on your shelves at a grocery store. It takes an extremely long time if it ever is going to happen at all.

Tayag: How do you respond to people who say that data sources are biased or corrupted in some ways? This is something I encounter a lot in my work. Where, for example, on a story I recently worked on about raw milk, a raw-milk farmer told me that all of the data that I was looking at was produced by institutions that are funded by Big Ag. How do you counter that sort of thinking?

Caulfield: I think being transparent about that reality is important. And I think it’s also important to highlight that on most of these topics, raw milk included, we can look at a body of evidence that points in the same direction, regardless of who the researchers are and how they’re funded.

Tayag: I often hear people’s frustration that there isn’t more scientific attention paid to alternative therapies. And perhaps if there were, we’d have more information about the benefits of cold plunges, let’s say, for example.

Caulfield: Something like cold plunges, you know, there is this—and first of all, there has been research on it. I think there’s ongoing research on it. And I applaud individuals that are working in this space. But I also—and this is where the frustration comes in—should research really be driven by pop-culture interest in a topic, or even the need to debunk something because of the pop-culture interest in the topic? Or should it be driven by scientific plausibility? Unfortunately, too often, our scientific resources are devoted to topics that have become popular, and we’re devoting resources to them because we have to debunk them. And of course, I mean, a really good example of that is something like the Wakefield study that suggested vaccines are tied to autism. Think of the tens of millions of dollars and the resources, right? And the researcher time that’s been wasted proving definitively that there’s no connection between autism and vaccines. And the only reason we had to do that is because, you know, in pop culture, that myth took on a life of its own. But we continue to study it, because we need more data to debunk it. Still—I recognize, and I’m glad, that people want evidence on things they’re interested in. That instinct is healthy. The instinct for wanting more evidence on something, and good evidence. That’s a good instinct. And that should be supported.

Tayag: We’re going to take a short break. But when we come back….

Tayag: What’s really going on here in this pursuit for longevity? Caulfield: So if you look at even people like Bryan Johnson, I mean, how often is that guy photographed with the shirt off? Tayag: Every time. I’ve never seen him with a shirt on. Caulfield: Yeah. So that, I think that tells us something….

Tayag: What’s really going on here in this pursuit for longevity?

Caulfield: So if you look at even people like Bryan Johnson, I mean, how often is that guy photographed with the shirt off?

Tayag: Every time. I’ve never seen him with a shirt on.

Caulfield: Yeah. So that, I think that tells us something….

Tayag: More on the longevity movement and its charisma, after the break.

[Ad break.]

Tayag: So, Timothy, what’s really going on here in this pursuit for longevity? You know, humans have been trying to defy death forever. And I’m curious, with the current longevity push, what are people really chasing? Are they really just trying to live longer?

Caulfield: I think this is a really fascinating question. Because I think the answer is both “Yes, they want to live longer”—but if you listen to these influencers, and you flip through their books, they’re promising more than just living longer, right? They are promising being better. They’re promising sexy abs, a better love life, more success at work. It’s an entire package, right? Living better, doing it better, being better. It’s about this optimization, uh, concept. The other fascinating thing with the longevity movement—and this is interesting because I think it very much is about men, which historically was the case too, right? Living longer is very much about men. And there’s this idea that if you’re not doing this, there’s something wrong with you. Like it’s a noble pursuit. It’s a righteous, righteous movement to be adopting all of these approaches. There was an interesting study—it was a qualitative study, so we have to be careful how we interpret the data—but basically, it was asking women their view on beauty products. And it was fascinating, because they kind of knew they probably didn’t work, maybe they worked, but they still felt compelled to to use them. This idea that you ought to be doing this, right—and if you’re not doing this, you’re failing in some way—is a pressure that’s always there.

Tayag: Mm hmm. And, is there a problem? Like, what are you concerned about with that pressure existing?

Caulfield: Well, first of all, I think that pressure is a marketing tool, right, to use these often unproven therapies. I think it can be exploitive, right, and can create anxiety. There are some studies—and, again, it’s hard to study this well, so don’t overinterpret this research—but it does suggest that this kind of pressure does shift how people think about things like public health. Because the emphasis is really you, like it’s your job, right, to do these things. And if you are not healthier and not optimizing, hey, that’s your problem. It’s not my problem; it’s not the government’s problem; it’s not, you know, your community’s problem. That’s your problem. If you emphasize sort of precision and personalization of health, it causes people to be less supportive of public-health interventions. But intuitively, that feels right, because it really is about you, you, you, you. The responsibility is on you. And if you’re not doing it, you’re failing.

Tayag: In pursuing all of these new biohacks—these techniques that are supposedly backed by new and cutting-edge science that isn’t even out there yet—it makes me wonder if there’s an element of mistrust involved in rejecting that public-health science that we already have long known about. Do you think mistrust plays a role?

Caulfield: I do. I do. I think it’s really important to recognize that historically, there are groups that have been treated terribly by the health-care system, by the scientific community. Women and people of color not listened to, their problems not taken seriously by conventional medicine. The biomedical-research institution has not done enough research on women—same with people of color. So this is a genuine problem. Unfortunately, what’s happening is the wellness industry, the longevity industry, they’re exploiting that issue. They’re not fixing it; they’re exploiting it. They’re creating more distrust in the conventional system and not rectifying the problems with the conventional system in order to sell products, to sell ideologies, to sell a brand. So it infuriates me, because these are real problems that need to be fixed. We didn’t get it right. You know: Let’s try to fix the problem, not sell products on the back of the problem.

[Music.]

Brennan: Yasmin, do you remember the other day we were working on an episode? And I happened out of the corner of my eye to see on your computer a headline about having a crayon’s worth of microplastic in my brain.

Tayag: I do remember that. You were freaked out.

Brennan: I did not like that. And do you remember what I asked you?

Tayag: What did you say?

Brennan: I instinctively was like, What do I do? And you said some very practical responses—like “Switch to glass containers; make sure your cutting board isn’t plastic”—but it was not enough to fully quiet my mind. I spiraled for a full day.

Tayag: Oh!

Brennan: Because the things that are in my control, right—my Tupperware, for example—feel so disproportionate to all the factors that are out of my control. And so I really understand the impulse right now to want to take matters into your own hands when it comes to health and wellness. When you feel like there are all of these systems that don’t have your health in mind.

Tayag: That is so real. Like, that is such a real way to feel right now: like you are not in control of so many things that affect your health. Our bodies are supposed to be our ground zero for autonomy and control. And there is something so empowering about being able to make healthy choices for yourself, especially if regulation is not keeping the plastic out of our brains. And it’s even more frustrating to realize that there are companies that know that you and thousands of other people are feeling that way and have convinced you that you can buy your way out of that fear.

Brennan: And that’s only looking at things through the individual perspective again, right? Because I want the crayons out of all the people I love’s brains too, not just my own. And even all the brains I don’t know. I don’t want crayon anywhere.

Tayag: You know, I didn’t think of it until Tim mentioned it, but it’s really true that what feels so pertinent to this particular moment, is how individualized the pursuit of living longer feels. It’s all about you and what you can do.

Brennan: Which is so ironic, because I have to guess that if we looked at the times in which the human lifespan has actually increased the most, I would guess it would be directly correlated with the invention of public-health initiatives.

Tayag: Oh, before we started to pasteurize milk—in, like, the late 1800s—a huge number of kids died from drinking bacteria-tainted milk.

Brennan: Right.

Tayag: And once pasteurization became standard, it turned that around. The kids stopped dying from milk. And then obviously vaccination, one of the biggest public-health initiatives, was estimated to have saved over 150 million lives in the last 50 years. And, you know, things we take for granted—like clean water or an actual sewage system, instead of flushing your waste into the East River—hugely decrease deaths from illnesses.

Brennan: But these inventions often take time, right? These new initiatives can move slowly. So what do we do now while we wait?

[Music.]

Tayag: So I want to zoom out a little bit and come back to this question of: How are people supposed to try to live longer if that is something they want to do? In your new book, Certainty of Illusion, you discuss the illusion of thinking you have the answers to everything because we have so much information at our fingertips. The illusion is the certainty. But how can people break free of the illusion that they can hack their way into living longer?

Caulfield: Alas, life is pretty random, you know. And we want to control it. That’s one of the reasons conspiracy theories emerge, right? You know: People desire patterns, they desire answers, they want answers that sort of fit with their worldview. So, you know, recognize that there often is a lot of uncertainty and randomness, and get comfortable with that. And there’s a lot of uncertainty in science. Science is about uncertainty, right? Evidence can evolve. If science said one thing 20 years ago—and science isn’t a person, it’s not an institution, it’s not an industry. Science is a process, right? And if we used that scientific process to come to a conclusion 20 years ago—and that evolved, and that has evolved—science isn’t wrong. That’s science working, right? You know, aspirin; our view on who should be taking aspirin as a preventative measure. That’s evolved, right? You know, our view on using BMI as a tool for public health. That’s evolved. That’s a good thing. That’s science evolving. Don’t view it as a reason to get frustrated about public health or the institution of science. Celebrate that evolution of science and of evidence. Because if you’re not using that systematic tool to accumulate knowledge, if you’re not using science to try to understand our world and make decisions, what are you going to use? We might have a huge breakthrough, and if that does happen it’s going to be really big news. I often ask—I did this in my last class, just last week—I asked the class: name 10 genuinely big scientific health breakthroughs that have happened in the last century. Right? Genuinely transformative health breakthroughs—it’s hard, right?—that have actually revolutionized. So you’ve got, like, clean water. That’s more than a hundred years. You have, you know, antibiotics. The list is pretty short, right? It’s pretty short. You know, the new GLP-1s—like Ozempic and its competitors—I think that’s fascinating, right? Recognizing that we’re still accumulating evidence about side effects and long-term benefits and harms, but it’s a pretty short list. And so: Remember that, right? Remember that, and lean back, and lean into those basic things we can do for ourselves, and—really, really importantly—for our community, building communities that foster those basic things.

[Music.]

Caulfield: Aging shouldn’t become a contest, you know, that you suffer through to get to the finish line. It’s not a contest. And holy cow, it sounds kind of New Age-y for a guy, such a science geek. But I think it really is about living well, and enjoying life, and enjoying your friends and family, and enjoying the journey. How New Age-y is that? And the irony, of course, is the research tells us that living well and living a happy life—that helps with longevity too, right? That helps your ultimate goal too. So, yeah: pulling back from this idea of optimizing every corner of your life to, hey, living well.

Tayag: Thanks so much, Tim. This has been such a pleasure.

Caulfield: Thank you.

[Music.]

Brennan: Yasmin, I’m still thinking about that question that I asked you about the microplastics. “What do I do?” And I think what I really wanted to hear in that moment was, “It’s fine. It’s okay.” You’re like … “It’s not.”

Tayag: Sorry.

Brennan: No, and I would know that it’s not truthful, right? I know that it’s not okay. It’s not fine. And in cognitive behavioral therapy, this is something called reassurance seeking. Have you heard of this?

Tayag: I haven’t.

Brennan: There’s this book written by these two psychologists, Martin Seif and Sally Winston, called Needing to Know for Sure, that a friend who has a very similar internal monologue to me recommended. And it’s a CBT guide for compulsive checking and reassurance seeking. And instead of trying to constantly seek affirmation that everything is okay, the book helps you try and sit in the uncertainty and get comfortable with the idea that often, we just can’t know what’s going to happen. Which is really hard.

Tayag: It’s so hard, I think, from like a health perspective. People are bad at thinking about risk. And that’s really what all of these public-health interventions, all of the health interventions that are available to us, are all about: reducing our risk. It will make you less likely to get cancer or to have a bone fracture later in life. But it’s never guaranteed, and that’s the whole thing about risk—there’s no 100 percent sure way to get rid of everything. But you’re bringing that risk down a little bit, and that’s the best we can do.

Brennan: And what I like about your conversation with Tim is that, you know, it kind of sits in a middle ground, right? We can’t 100 percent know that a certain supplement is going to increase our lifespan. And we can’t know that a new superfood is going to definitely help us age up. But there are these tangible steps that we can work into our day to day at any point to commit to a practice of living healthier.

Tayag: Yeah; we don’t have all the answers, but we have some of the answers.

Brennan: And I think I can sit in that. You know, that might be enough for me. And for the days that I can’t, when I can’t sit in that thought, you know—those are the days that I delight in jumping into water.

Charles de Gaulle began his war memoirs with this sentence: “All my life I have had a certain idea about France.” Well, all my life I have had a certain idea about America. I have thought of America as a deeply flawed nation that is nonetheless a force for tremendous good in the world. From Abraham Lincoln to Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan and beyond, Americans fought for freedom and human dignity and against tyranny; we promoted democracy, funded the Marshall Plan, and saved millions of people across Africa from HIV and AIDS. When we caused harm—Vietnam, Iraq—it was because of our overconfidence and naivete, not evil intentions.

Until January 20, 2025, I didn’t realize how much of my very identity was built on this faith in my country’s goodness—on the idea that we Americans are partners in a grand and heroic enterprise, that our daily lives are ennobled by service to that cause. Since January 20, as I have watched America behave vilely—toward our friends in Canada and Mexico, toward our friends in Europe, toward the heroes in Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office—I’ve had trouble describing the anguish I’ve experienced. Grief? Shock? Like I’m living through some sort of hallucination? Maybe the best description for what I’m feeling is moral shame: To watch the loss of your nation’s honor is embarrassing and painful.

George Orwell is a useful guide to what we’re witnessing. He understood that it is possible for people to seek power without having any vision of the good. “The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake,” an apparatchik says in 1984. “We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power.” How is power demonstrated? By making others suffer. Orwell’s character continues: “Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation.”

Russell Vought, Donald Trump’s budget director, sounds like he walked straight out of 1984. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains,” he said of federal workers, speaking at an event in 2023. “We want to put them in trauma.”

Since coming back to the White House, Trump has caused suffering among Ukrainians, suffering among immigrants who have lived here for decades, suffering among some of the best people I know. Many of my friends in Washington are evangelical Christians who found their vocation in public service—fighting sex trafficking, serving the world’s poor, protecting America from foreign threats, doing biomedical research to cure disease. They are trying to live lives consistent with the gospel of mercy and love. Trump has devastated their work. He isn’t just declaring war on “wokeness”; he’s declaring war on Christian service—on any kind of service, really.

If there is an underlying philosophy driving Trump, it is this: Morality is for suckers. The strong do what they want and the weak suffer what they must. This is the logic of bullies everywhere. And if there is a consistent strategy, it is this: Day after day, the administration works to create a world where ruthless people can thrive. That means destroying any institution or arrangement that might check the strongman’s power. The rule of law, domestic or international, restrains power, so it must be eviscerated. Inspectors general, judge advocate general officers, oversight mechanisms, and watchdog agencies are a potential restraint on power, so they must be fired or neutered. The truth itself is a restraint on power, so it must be abandoned. Lying becomes the language of the state.

Trump’s first term was a precondition for his second. His first term gradually eroded norms and acclimatized America to a new sort of regime. This laid the groundwork for his second term, in which he’s making the globe a playground for gangsters.

We used to live in a world where ideologies clashed, but ideologies don’t seem to matter anymore. The strongman understanding of power is on the march. Power is like money: the more the better. Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the rest of the world’s authoritarians are forming an axis of ruthlessness before our eyes. Trumpism has become a form of nihilism that is devouring everything in its path.

The pathetic thing is that I didn’t see this coming even though I’ve been living around these people my whole adult life. I joined the conservative movement in the 1980s, when I worked in turn at National Review, The Washington Times, and The Wall Street Journal editorial page. There were two kinds of people in our movement back then, the conservatives and the reactionaries. We conservatives earnestly read Milton Friedman, James Burnham, Whittaker Chambers, and Edmund Burke. The reactionaries just wanted to shock the left. We conservatives oriented our lives around writing for intellectual magazines; the reactionaries were attracted to TV and radio. We were on the political right but had many liberal friends; they had contempt for anyone not on the anti-establishment right. They were not pro-conservative—they were anti-left. I have come to appreciate that this is an important difference.

I should have understood this much sooner, because the reactionaries had revealed their true character as far back as January 1986. A group of progressive students at Dartmouth had erected a shantytown on campus to protest apartheid. One night, a group of 12 students, most of them associated with the right-wing Dartmouth Review, descended on the shanties with sledgehammers and smashed them down.

Even then I was appalled. Apartheid was evil, and worth opposing. A nighttime raid with sledgehammers seemed more Gestapo than Burkean. But conservative intellectuals didn’t take this seriously enough. In large part, I think this was because we looked down on the Dartmouth Review mafia, whose members had included Laura Ingraham and Dinesh D’Souza. Their intellectual standards were so obviously third-rate. I don’t know how to put this politely, but they just seemed creepy—nakedly ambitious in a way that I thought would destroy them in the end.

From the December 2024 issue: David Brooks on how the Ivy League broke America

Instead, history has smiled on them. A prominent publisher of right-wing authors once told me that the way to sell conservative books is not to write a good book—it’s to write a book that will offend the left, thereby causing the reactionaries to rally to your side and buy it. That led to books with titles such as The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left, and to Ann Coulter’s entire career. Owning the libs became a lucrative strategy.

Of course, the left made it easy for them. The left really did purge conservatives from universities and other cultural power centers. The left really did valorize a “meritocratic” caste system that privileged the children of the affluent and screwed the working class. The left really did pontificate to their unenlightened moral inferiors on everything from gender to the environment. The left really did create a stifling orthodoxy that stamped out dissent. If you tell half the country that their voices don’t matter, then the voiceless are going to flip over the table.

But although Trump may have campaigned as a MAGA populist, leveraging this working-class resentment to gain power, he governs as a Palm Beach elitist. Trump and Elon Musk are billionaires who went to the University of Pennsylvania. J. D. Vance went to Yale Law School. Pete Hegseth went to Princeton and Harvard. Vivek Ramaswamy went to Yale and Harvard. Stephen Miller went to Duke. Ted Cruz went to Princeton and Harvard. Many of Musk’s DOGE workers, according to The New York Times, come from elite institutions—Harvard, Princeton, Morgan Stanley, McKinsey, Wharton. These are the Vineyard Vines nihilists, the spiritual descendants of the elite bad boys at the Dartmouth Review. This political moment isn’t populists versus elitists; it is, as I’ve written before, like a civil war in a prep school where the sleazy rich kids are taking on the pretentious rich kids.

Derek Thompson: DOGE’s reign of ineptitude

The MAGA elite rode to power on working-class votes, but—trust me, I know some of them—they don’t care about the working class. Trump and his crew could have taken office with actual plans to make life better for working-class Americans. An administration that cared about the working class would seek to address its problems, such as the fact that the poorest Americans die an average of 10 to 15 years younger than their higher-income counterparts, or that by sixth grade, many of the children in the poorest school districts have fallen four grade levels behind those in the richest. An administration that cared about these people would have offered a bipartisan industrial policy to create working-class jobs.

These faux populists have no interest in that. Instead of helping workers, they focus on civil war with their left-wing fellow elites. During Trump’s first months in office, one of their highest priorities has been to destroy the places where they think liberal elites work—the scientific community, the foreign-aid community, the Kennedy Center, the Department of Education, universities.

It turns out that when you mix narcissism and nihilism, you create an acid that corrodes every belief system it touches.

This Trumpian cocktail has eaten away at Christianity, a faith oriented around the marginalized. Blessed are the meek. Blessed are the poor in spirit. The poor are closer to God than the rich. Again and again, Jesus explicitly renounced worldly power.

Read: Evangelicals made a bad trade

But if Trumpism has a central tenet, it is untrammeled lust for worldly power. In Trumpian circles, many people ostentatiously identify as Christians but don’t talk about Jesus very much; they have crosses on their chest but Nietzsche in their heart—or, to be more precise, a high-school sophomore’s version of Nietzsche.

To Nietzsche, all of those Christian pieties about justice, peace, love, and civility are constraints that the weak erect to emasculate the strong. In this view, Nietzscheanism is a morality for winners. It worships the pagan virtues: power, courage, glory, will, self-assertion. The Nietzschean Übermenschen—which Trump and Musk clearly believe themselves to be—offer the promise of domination over those sick sentimentalists who practice compassion.

Two decades ago, Michael Gerson, a graduate of Wheaton College, a prominent evangelical institution, helped George W. Bush start the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which has saved 25 million lives in Africa and elsewhere. I traveled with Gerson to Namibia, Mozambique, and South Africa, where dying people had recovered and returned to their families, and were leading active lives. It was a proud moment to be an American. Vought—Trump’s budget director, who also graduated from Wheaton—championed the evisceration of PEPFAR, which has now been set in motion by executive order, effectively sentencing thousands to death. Project 2025, of which Vought was a principal architect, helped lay the groundwork for the dismantling of USAID; its gutting appears to have ended a program to supply malaria protection to 53 million people and cut emergency food packages for starving children. Twenty years is a short time in which to have traveled the long moral distance from Gerson to Vought.

From the April 2018 issue: Michael Gerson on Trump and the evangelical temptation

Trumpian nihilism has eviscerated conservatism. The people in this administration are not conservatives. They are the opposite of conservatives. Conservatives once believed in steady but incremental reform; Elon Musk believes in rash and instantaneous disruption. Conservatives once believed that moral norms restrain and civilize us, habituating us to virtue; Trumpism trashes moral norms in every direction, riding forward on a tide of adultery, abuse, cruelty, immaturity, grift, and corruption. Conservatives once believed in constitutional government and the Madisonian separation of powers; Trump bulldozes checks and balances, declaiming on social media, “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” Reagan promoted democracy abroad because he thought it the political system most consistent with human dignity; the Trump administration couldn’t care less about promoting democracy—or about human dignity.

How does this end? Will anyone on the right finally stand up to the Trumpian onslaught? Will our institutions withstand the nihilist assault? Is America on the verge of ruin?

In February, about a month into Trump’s second term, I spoke at a gathering of conservatives in London called the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship. Some of the speakers were pure populist (Vivek Ramaswamy, Mike Johnson, and Nigel Farage). But others were center-right or not neatly ideological (Niall Ferguson, Bishop Robert Barron, and my Atlantic colleague Arthur C. Brooks).

David Brooks: Confessions of a Republican exile

In some ways, it was like the conservative conferences I’ve been attending for decades. I listened to a woman from Senegal talking about trying to make her country’s culture more entrepreneurial. I met the head of a charter school in the Bronx that focuses on character formation. But in other ways, this conference was startlingly different.

In my own talk, I sympathized with the populist critique of what has gone wrong in Western societies. But I shared with the audience my dark view of President Trump. Unsurprisingly, a large segment of the audience booed vigorously. One man screamed that I was a traitor and stormed out. But many other people cheered. Even in conservative precincts infected by reactionary MAGA-ism, some people are evidently tired of Trumpian brutality.

As the conference went on, I noticed a contest of metaphors. The true conservatives used metaphors of growth or spiritual recovery. Society is an organism that needs healing, or it is a social fabric that needs to be rewoven. A poet named Joshua Luke Smith said we needed to be the seeds of regrowth, to plant the trees for future generations. His incantation was beatitudinal: “Remember the poor. Remember the poor.”

But others relied on military metaphors. We are in the midst of civilizational war. “They”—the wokesters, the radical Muslims, the left—are destroying our culture. There were allusions to the final epochal battles in The Lord of the Rings. The implication was that Sauron is leading his Orc hordes to destroy us. We are the heroic remnant. We must crush or be crushed.

The warriors tend to think people like me are soft and naive. I tend to think they are catastrophizing narcissists. When I look at Trump acolytes, I see a swarm of Neville Chamberlains who think they’re Winston Churchill.

I understand the seductive power of a demagogue who tells you that the people who look down on you are evil. I understand the seductive power of being told that your civilization is on the verge of total collapse, and that everything around you is degeneracy and ruin. This message gives you a kind of terrifying thrill: The stakes are apocalyptic. Your life has meaning and urgency. Everything is broken; let’s burn it all down.

I understand why people who feel alienated would want to follow the leader who speaks about domination and combat, not the one who speaks about healing and cooperation. It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve read Edmund Burke or the Gospel of Matthew—it’s still tempting to throw away all of your beliefs to support the leader who promises to be “your retribution.”

America may well enter a period of democratic decay and international isolation. It takes decades to develop strong alliances, and to build the structures and customs of democracy—and only weeks to decimate them, as we’ve now seen. And yet I find myself confident that America will survive this crisis. Many nations, including our own, have gone through worse and bloodier crises and recovered. In Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis, the historian and scientist Jared Diamond provides case studies—Japan in the late 19th century, Finland and Germany after World War II, Indonesia after the 1960s, Chile and Australia during and after the ’70s—of countries that came back stronger after crisis, collapse, or defeat. To these examples, I’d add Britain in the 1830s and ’40s, and the 1980s, and South Korea in the 1980s. Some of these countries (such as Japan) endured war; others (Chile) endured mass torture and “disappearances”; still others (Britain and Australia) endured social decay and national decline. All of them eventually healed and came back.

America itself has already been through numerous periods of rupture and repair. Some people think we’re living through a period of unprecedented tumult, but the Civil War and the Great Depression were much worse. So were the late 1960s—assassinations, riots, a failed war, surging crime rates, a society coming apart. From January 1969 until April 1970, there were 4,330 bombings in the U.S., or about nine a day. But by the 1980s and ’90s—after getting through Watergate, stagflation, and the Carter-era “malaise” of the ’70s—we had recovered. As brutal and disruptive as the tumult of the late 1960s was, it helped the country shake off some of its persistent racism and sexism, and made possible a freer and more individualistic ethos.

But the most salient historical parallel might be the America of the 1830s. Andrew Jackson is the American president who most resembles Trump—power-hungry, rash, narcissistic, driven by animosity. He was known by his opponents as “King Andrew” for his expansions of executive power. “The man we have made our President has made himself our despot, and the Constitution now lies a heap of ruins at his feet,” Senator Asher Robbins of Rhode Island said. “When the way to his object lies through the Constitution, the Constitution has not the strength of a cobweb to restrain him from breaking through it.” Jackson brazenly defied the Supreme Court on a ruling about Cherokee Nation territory (a defiance, it should be noted, that Vice President Vance has explicitly endorsed). “Though we live under the form of a republic,” Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story wrote, “we are in fact under the absolute rule of a single man.”

But Jackson made the classic mistake of the populist: He overreached. Fueled by personal hostility toward elites, he destroyed the Second Bank of the United States, an early precursor to the Federal Reserve System, and helped spark an economic depression that ruined the administration of his chosen successor, Martin Van Buren.

In response to Jackson, the Whig Party arose in the 1830s to create a new political and social order. Devoutly anti-authoritarian, the Whigs were a cultural, civic, and political force all at once. They emphasized both traditional morality and progressive improvements. They agitated for prison reform and for keeping the Sabbath, for more women’s participation in politics and for a strong military, for government-funded public schools and for pro-business government policies. They were opposed to Jackson’s monstrous Indian Removal Act, and to the Democratic Party’s reactionary, white-supremacist social vision. Whereas Jacksonian Democrats emphasized negative liberty—get your hands off me—the Whigs, who would turn into the early Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln, emphasized positive liberty, empowering Americans to live bigger, better lives with things such as expanded economic credit, free public education, and stronger legal protections including due process and property rights.

Though we’ve come to call the early-to-mid-19th century the Age of Jackson, the historian Daniel Walker Howe notes that it was not Jackson but the Whigs who created the America we know today. “As economic modernizers, as supporters of strong national government, and as humanitarians more receptive than their rivals to talent regardless of race and gender,” Howe writes, the Whigs “facilitated the transformation of the United States from a collection of parochial agricultural communities into a cosmopolitan nation integrated by commerce, industry, information, and voluntary associations as well as by political ties.” Looking back, Howe concludes, we can see that even though they were not the dominant party of their time, the Whigs “were the party of America’s future.” To begin its recovery from Trumpism, America needs its next Whig moment.

Yes, we have reached a point of traumatic rupture. A demagogue has come to power and is ripping everything down. But what’s likely to happen is that the demagogue will start making mistakes, because incompetence is built into the nihilistic project. Nihilists can only destroy, not build. Authoritarian nihilism is inherently stupid. I don’t mean that Trumpists have low IQs. I mean they do things that run directly against their own interests. They are pathologically self-destructive. When you create an administration in which one man has all the power and everybody else has to flatter his voracious ego, stupidity results. Authoritarians are also morally stupid. Humility, prudence, and honesty are not just nice virtues to have—they are practical tools that produce good outcomes. When you replace them with greed, lust, hypocrisy, and dishonesty, terrible things happen.

From the September 2023 issue: David Brooks on why Americans are so awful to one another

The DOGE children are doubtless brilliant in certain ways, but they know as much about government as I know about rocketry. They announced an $8 billion cut to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract—though if they had read their own documents correctly, they would have realized that the cut was less than $8 million. They eliminated workers from the National Nuclear Security Administration, apparently without realizing that this agency controls nuclear security, and had to undo some of those cuts shortly thereafter. Trump seems to be trying to give a bunch of Sam Bankman-Frieds access to America’s nuclear arsenal and IRS records. What could go wrong?

When Trump creates an unnecessary crisis, it’s unlikely to be a small one. The proverbial “adults in the room” who contained crises in Trump’s first term are gone. Whatever the second-term crisis—runaway inflation? a global trade war? a cratered economy and plummeting stock market? an out-of-control conflict in China? botched pandemic management? a true hijacking of the Constitution precipitated by defiance of the courts?—it is likely to crater his support and shift historical momentum.

But although Trumpism’s collapse is a necessary condition for national recovery, it is not a sufficient one. Its demise must be followed by the hard work necessary to achieve true civic and political renewal.

Progress is not always a smooth or merry ride. For a few decades, nations live according to one paradigm. Then it stops working and gets destroyed. When the time comes to build a new paradigm, progressives talk about economic redistribution; conservatives talk about cultural and civic repair. History shows that you need both: Recovery from national crisis demands comprehensive reinvention at all levels of society. If you look back across the centuries, you find that this process requires several interconnected efforts.

First, a national shift in values. In the late 19th century, for example, as the country went through the wrenching process of industrialization, America was traumatized by severe recessions and mass urban poverty. In response, social Darwinism gave way to the social-gospel movement. Social Darwinism, associated with thinkers such as Herbert Spencer, valorized survival of the fittest and claimed that the poor are poor because of inferior abilities. The social-gospel movement, associated with theologians such as Walter Rauschenbusch, emphasized the systemic causes of poverty, including the Gilded Age’s concentration of corporate power. By the early 20th century, most mainline Protestant denominations had signed on to the Social Creed of the Churches, which called for, among other things, the abolition of child labor and the creation of disability insurance.

Second, nations that hang together through crisis have a strong national identity—they return to their roots. They have a leader who replaces the amoralism of the nihilists, or, say, the immorality of slavery, with a strong redefinition of the nation’s moral mission, the way Lincoln redefined America at Gettysburg.

Third, a civic renaissance. After the social gospel took root, Americans in the 1890s and early 1900s launched and participated in a series of social movements and civic organizations: United Way, the NAACP, the Sierra Club, the settlement-house movement, the American Legion.

Fourth, a national reassessment. As Jared Diamond notes, nations that turn around don’t catastrophize. Rather, they develop a clear-eyed view of what’s working and not working, and they pursue careful, selective change. According to Diamond’s research, the leaders of successful reform movements also take responsibility for their part in the crisis. For instance, Germany’s leaders accepted responsibility for the country’s Nazi past; Finland’s leaders took responsibility for an unrealistic foreign policy before World War II, when they had to deal with a looming Soviet Union on their border; and Australia’s leaders took responsibility in the 1970s for a political culture and foreign policy that had become overly dependent on Britain.

Fifth, a surge of political reform. In 1830s and ’40s Britain—racked by social chaos, bank failures, a severe depression, riots, and crushing wealth inequality—Prime Minister Robert Peel, a leader of great moral rectitude, built the modern police force, reduced tariffs, pushed railway legislation that literally laid the tracks for British industrialization, and helped pass the Factory Act of 1844, which regulated workplaces. In early-20th-century America, Progressives produced a comparable flurry of effective reforms that pulled the country out of its industrialization crisis.

Part of political reform is an expansion of the circle of power. What that would require in America today is, among other things, a broad effort to include working-class and conservative voices in what have traditionally been cultural bastions of elite progressivism—universities, the nonprofit sector, the civil service, the mainstream media.

Derek Thompson: Abundance can be America’s next political order

Finally, economic expansion. Economic growth can salve many wounds. Pursuing a so-called abundance agenda—a set of policies aimed at reducing government regulation and increasing investment in innovation, and expanding the supply of housing, energy, and health care—is the most promising way to achieve that expansion.

in the long term, Trumpism is doomed. Power without prudence and humility invariably fails. Nations, like people, change not when times are good but in response to pain. At a moment when Trumpism seems to be devouring everything, the temptation is to believe that this time is different.

But history doesn’t stop moving. Even now, as I travel around the country, I see the forces of repair gathering in neighborhoods and communities. If you’re part of an organization that builds trust across class, you’re fighting Trumpism. If you’re a Democrat jettisoning insular faculty-lounge progressivism in favor of a Whig-like working-class abundance agenda, you’re fighting Trumpism. If you are standing up for a moral code of tolerance and pluralism that can hold America together, you’re fighting Trumpism.

Over time, changes in values lead to changes in relationships, which lead to changes in civic life, which eventually lead to changes in policy and then in the general trajectory of the nation. It starts slow, but as the Book of Job says, the sparks will fly upward.

## Wayne Gretzky, Former Canadian Hero

# Wayne Gretzky, Former Canadian Hero


作者:  | 发布时间: April 6, 2025


His countrymen aren’t mourning the loss of his scoring record.

In the summer of 1988, when I was 14 years old, I went camping with my family not far outside Toronto. We emerged from the woods and I wandered over to a newspaper box by the side of the road. Through its cracked glass, I saw a front-page picture of Wayne Gretzky, weeping. He’d been traded from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings. I followed my idol’s lead and burst into tears.

Gretzky, back then at least, was more than a hockey player to Canadians. He was homegrown royalty, a player of such quality, of such rare possibility, that he transcended the game we’ve always used to define ourselves. I wasn’t even a true hockey kid, but I had Gretzky’s signature Titan stick, white with red lettering, and a pennant on my bedroom wall that memorialized his 1981–82 season, when he pocketed 92 goals and 120 assists for 212 points, all records. He went on to better that assists mark five times and reset his own points record with 215 in 1985–86. No one else has recorded more than 200 points in a season; he did four times, one for each Stanley Cup that he won. He retired in 1999 with 61 records, including the record for most records, and he still has more assists than anyone else has managed points. He changed hockey math, and with it our country’s measure of itself.

Today Gretzky surrendered one of his most cherished records—the most goals in an NHL career—to Alex Ovechkin, a 39-year-old Russian who plays for the Washington Capitals. Ovechkin scored his 895th goal, one better than Gretzky’s 894, in the second period against the Islanders in New York. He belly flopped onto the ice in ecstasy and relief before he was mobbed by his teammates, and then the game stopped to celebrate the greatest goal scorer who ever lived.

Gretzky, 64 years old and red-faced, was there to witness the occasion, the way Gordie Howe had encouraged Gretzky’s pursuit of his career-goals record. For more than a century, Canadians had taken turns eclipsing one another, a chain of succession that began with Joe Malone and included Howie Morenz and Maurice Richard, until Ovechkin overtook them all, claiming what Spencer Carbery, the Canadian-born coach of the Capitals, called “the greatest record in our sport.”

After Gretzky was traded to the Kings, his departure was cast as a mid-level national tragedy. “The biggest name in Canadian sports, the man hockey fans call the Great One, is going to the United States,” CBC anchor Knowlton Nash announced with a solemnity usually reserved for the deaths of princesses and declarations of war.

Not long ago, Canadians might have regarded the loss of Gretzky’s record with similar distress. Today they’re reacting with ambivalence. Some percentage of Canadians, including recent waves of Ukrainian refugees, will feel uneasy about the record belonging to Ovechkin, a vocal supporter of Vladimir Putin. But for many, the record had already slipped away—if not in 1988 then in 2025, when Donald Trump became the U.S. president again and Gretzky was there to cheer him on too.

Trump soon enraged Canadians with his “51st state” and “Governor Justin Trudeau” garbage, his trade war, and his open desire to annex our country. Anthem singers started getting earfuls at hockey games. Gretzky, who appears to have spent more time at Mar-a-Lago than in Canada lately, stayed a little too quiet about everything. When Canada and the U.S met in the final of the 4 Nations Face-Off in February, Gretzky was named our honorary captain and seemed reluctant to do it, without so much as a maple-leaf pin on his jacket lapel. After Canada won in overtime—I haven’t yelled at my TV like that in years—Gretzky gave the players red caps that said Be Great, a Trumpian echo that was either intentional or tone-deaf. He ended that debate on Friday night when he watched Ovechkin’s chase alongside Kash Patel, Trump’s FBI director. They sat together again this afternoon.

By then, Canadians were already calling Gretzky the “Great Once.” Someone smeared literal shit on his statue outside Edmonton’s Rogers Place; petitions were launched to rename the city’s Wayne Gretzky Drive and a parkway and arena in his hometown of Brantford, Ontario. Janet Gretzky, his American wife, came to his defense on Instagram: “I have never met anyone who is more Proud to be a Canadian, and it has broken his heart to read and see the mean comments,” she wrote. She deleted the post after other proud Canadians disputed her assessment.

Back in 1988, many of us in Canada blamed her for Gretzky’s exit. They had married weeks before the trade, a few months after her star turn in Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach. Los Angeles must have been her idea, we assumed, a misogynist trope that survived even after it became obvious that Gretzky’s exile was self-imposed. We erected statues in his honor and named roads and arenas after him anyway. He went to St. Louis, to New York, to Phoenix, and somehow remained claimed by us. In 2009, we named him a Companion of the Order of Canada, our highest civilian honor, and ignored that he didn’t bother coming home to pick up his medal.

Now it’s time for hard truths. Gretzky has lived in the U.S. longer than he lived up here, in an American mansion with an American wife and American kids, palling around on American golf courses with an American president who says that Canada “only works as a state.” It might break Gretzky’s heart to hear it, but a lot of Canadians don’t think of him as one of us anymore. Once, we cried over where he played his hockey. His face could have been on our money, never mind his name on our sticks. But he’s made clear his choice, and so we’ve made ours. Wayne Gretzky’s records, like his faults, are singular. The loss is his and his alone.

# Jack Black Knew Best


作者:  | 发布时间: April 6, 2025


The veteran performer understood how to engage the live audience on SNL—to often-hilarious effect.

For a show that prides itself on being, well, live, Saturday Night Live doesn’t usually thrive on engaging its in-studio audience. The machine of the long-running program doesn’t lend itself to spontaneity; any participation from the crowd is typically scripted.

But last night’s episode had a shaggier, looser vibe. Credit that to the host, Jack Black, and, in a surprise twist, last week’s musical guest, Morgan Wallen.

Wallen wasn’t actually present; the country musician created headlines last week when he bucked the tradition of sharing pleasantries during the goodbyes at the end of the night and abruptly walked off-stage straight to camera. The move was perceived as rude to the cast. Shortly thereafter, he posted a photo of his private jet to Instagram with the caption, “Get me to God’s country,” a seeming culture-war taunt that quickly became a meme.

In last night’s cold open, the SNL cast member James Austin Johnson, the show’s resident Donald Trump impressionist, responded to the dig. In character as the president, Johnson launched into a wandering monologue about Trump’s wide-reaching tariffs, which included targets such as the unpopulated McDonald Islands. SNL’s Trump envisioned the islands as a paradise inhabited by anthropomorphic Chicken McNuggets and a large, hula-skirt-wearing burger—a riff on the president’s well-documented love of McDonald’s. Holding up a poster of this fantasy, Johnson tossed off: “Get me to God’s country, right?”

The crowd roared knowingly, bursting into applause. “Remember that?” Johnson said, egging them on, as though the reference to Wallen was an inside joke shared by everyone there. The gag almost gave permission for the assembled group to get a little rowdier than usual.

Black’s monologue took up that challenge. The comic actor, who has maintained his goofy, rock-and-roll-loving persona his entire career, erupted into a guitar anthem about his return to hosting after a 20-year absence. He climbed stairs into a portion of the audience we don’t usually see, the group perched high above the set. He sat on a man’s lap, singing directly into his face “I bet this guy did not know he’d be on TV.” The man looked sheepishly at the camera as if to confirm that fact.

As Black traveled farther into the seats, he brought out a marching band to the delight of the guests, who started clapping along to the tune. Kieran Culkin and Bill Burr, co-stars in a new Broadway production of Glengarry Glen Ross, looked particularly charmed. They were apparently just there to enjoy the evening and suddenly ended up on-screen as if they were attending a sporting event.

Black’s participatory energy extended to his sketch work too. In “One Uppers,” Black joined cast members for a bit about college friends trying to impress one another with their respective virtue. Every time someone would brag about, say, giving up social media, thrifting a sweater, or going to a protest, the performer would break the fourth wall, turning to the camera with an overwrought pious expression, implicating viewers in the competition.

By the time “Weekend Update” came around, the audience seemed primed for some spontaneity. In a guest segment about the White House Correspondents’ Association’s cancellation of the comedian Amber Ruffin’s hosting stint at their annual dinner, Ego Nwodim commented on how she would handle the job. Instead of roasting politicians, she told the “Update” anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che, she would make fun of the food. As she strutted in front of the desk taking on the persona of “Miss Eggy,” she let loose with a series of intentionally hacky jokes and the swag of a Def Comedy Jam appearance. The audience was eager to play along—so eager that it actually yelled out replies when she started a call-and-response as part of her routine.

When she riffed on Cory Booker’s 25-hour-long filibuster, saying she’d had her “fill of bustas,” she proclaimed, “because these men ain’t what?” The crowd yelled “Shit!” before the word could get bleeped out. Nwodim was clearly surprised but also seemed a little thrilled, merrily noting that the show was going to get fined as Jost and Che howled with laughter behind her. It was a classic moment of live television—one that unexpectedly brought the performers and the audience just a little bit closer to each other.

## The Cabinet Secretary Who Wants His Cookies Freshly Baked

# The Cabinet Secretary Who Wants His Cookies Freshly Baked


作者:  | 发布时间: April 6, 2025


The unusual requests made of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s staff are raising concerns all the way to the White House.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum likes chocolate-chip cookies—preferably freshly baked and still warm.

This peculiar fact became the talk of the Department of the Interior in recent weeks after his chief of staff, JoDee Hanson, made an unusual request of the political appointees in his office: Learn to regularly bake cookies for Burgum and his guests, using the industrial ovens at the department headquarters.

That request was not the only move by his team that has alarmed some Interior officials. Four people familiar with Burgum’s leadership, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told The Atlantic that Burgum was focused on his status as the leader of a minor Cabinet department and that those who ran his office repeatedly made unusual demands to his employees. His office leadership once instructed political appointees to act as servers for a multicourse meal. They also dispatched a U.S. Park Police helicopter for his personal transportation. On at least one occasion, a political appointee was told to remake the cookies because the batch was subpar, according to three people.

Some of the concerns have been elevated to senior White House officials, according to the sources. One person familiar with the behavior described Burgum as “Doug the diva.” Three people said the concerns have been widely discussed among lower-level staff at the Department of the Interior. Two people said political appointees in Burgum’s office have been seen crying because of the demands placed on them.

“These pathetic smears are from unnamed cowards who don’t know Doug Burgum and are trying to stop President Trump’s Energy Dominance agenda,” Interior spokesperson Katie Martin told us in a statement. “Everyone knows Secretary Burgum always leads with gratitude and is humbly working with President Trump.”

Two Interior Department officials, speaking anonymously to push back on what they say are false claims, said the cookies—which are made from store-bought, premade dough and served to guests and staff in a basket—are simply part of the hospitality the department offers to visitors. The helicopter trip, they said, was arranged by his security detail. One of these officials also pointed out that most of these complaints are from the early days of the administration, when the office was still ramping up and few political appointees were on staff.

“He’s not demanding cookies, he’s not demanding a helicopter,” an Interior Department official told us in response. “It is antithetical to diva behavior.”

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly similarly dismissed any concern when asked for a comment on this story. “Only The Atlantic could spin baking warm cookies for guests as a bad thing. Cold-hearted people!” she wrote to us in a statement. “Secretary Burgum is doing an outstanding job leading the Department of Interior.”

Burgum is not the first Trump Cabinet secretary to spark controversy inside a federal department for the way the secretary’s office is run. During Trump’s first term, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in 2018 amid at least a dozen federal investigations that included claims that he was overspending on travel and tasking federal workers to do personal work. Former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was investigated after emails surfaced showing a federal worker had been tasked with sending Christmas ornaments to her family. And congressional Republicans investigated reports that former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke planned to spend $139,000 on replacement doors for his office. He later testified that the final cost was $75,000, and that the high price was required because of the historic nature of the building.

Before entering politics, Burgum was a successful businessman, amassing a net worth above $100 million. The former North Dakota governor nearly got the nod last summer to be Trump’s running mate, ending up on Trump’s list of three finalists. When Trump won, he was hoping for a high-profile role, such as secretary of state. Trump appointed Burgum instead to Interior, also naming him to the National Security Council at the White House and to be chair of the newly formed National Energy Dominance Council.

Larger Cabinet agencies typically come with more perks for senior officials, like multiple food-service options and government aircraft for official travel. That is not the case at the Department of the Interior, which manages the National Park Service and about one-fifth of America’s land, as well as the federal government’s relationship with Indian tribes. The only restaurant at the C Street headquarters, Bison Bistro, closed during the coronavirus pandemic and has not reopened. Burgum’s Democratic predecessor, Deb Haaland, was known to periodically walk across the street to the Met Cafe for its buffet lunch.

Shortly after his confirmation, Burgum had breakfast with Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the Treasury headquarters next to the White House, according to three people briefed on the events. Treasury has a dedicated wait staff that can serve multicourse meals for the secretary and his guests in a private room, according to a former Treasury official. One departmental dining space, known as the “small conference room,” displays the silverware of Alexander Hamilton, the nation’s first Treasury secretary.

Days after the breakfast, on February 11, Burgum’s office instructed four political appointees in the Office of the Secretary, who have no formal role in food service, to stage a similar, multicourse lunch for a meeting with Wright and Mark Christie, the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. His office ordered catered food, and the political appointees plated it into multiple serving courses and washed the dishes afterward. Concerns about the use of political appointees—who are supposed to be helping to run the department—to serve food to the secretary later reached the White House, two people said.

The two Interior Department officials said that because the department has no cafeteria, staff will help serve food if Burgum has guests over. Burgum’s meal with Wright and Christie was not elaborate, they said—salad, lasagna, and dessert. “We’re talking three plates, three forks,” one of the officials said, adding that it was the only time Burgum hosted lunch at the department.

On February 7, Burgum’s office ordered Eagle One, a U.S. Park Police helicopter stationed in Anacostia Park, to land at polo fields near the National Mall to transport him to Andrews Air Force Base, where he was scheduled to meet President Trump and fly on Air Force One to Florida for the weekend. The eight-minute helicopter flight from Washington to Andrews is a standard privilege for presidents, who have their own helicopter fleet maintained by the U.S. Marines. Interior secretaries typically endure the 30-to-40-minute drive to Andrews.

The Aviation Unit of the U.S. Park Police, a division of the Department of the Interior, does not routinely handle VIP transport, according to a U.S. Park Police fact sheet. The blue-and-white helicopters launch to provide additional aerial surveillance during presidential and other dignitary movements, and are used for “medevac, search and rescue, high-risk prisoner transport,” and to support for law-enforcement operations.

Interior travel guidelines state that “oﬃcial travel to give speeches, attend conferences or meetings, or make routine site visits” is not an acceptable justification for “mission requirement” travel in government aircraft. There is a separate category of “required use travel” that allows officials to use government aircraft for “certain specific communications, security and exceptional scheduling requirements.” Separate federal regulations require written permission from a senior legal officer for such travel.

A person briefed on Burgum’s use of the Park Police helicopter said the aircraft was requested by the secretary’s security team after concerns were raised that he might not make the Air Force One departure time after a meeting at the White House. Burgum had nothing to do with the decision to use the helicopter, that person said.

“The Secretary was slated to staff the President of the United States for a trip over the Gulf of America,” Martin told us in a statement. “When it was clear that afternoon D.C. traffic would not allow him to travel by vehicle, the decision was made to take a helicopter to ensure he arrived at Andrews on time to staff President Trump, which is a core mission of the Secretary of the Interior.”

Burgum, the two Interior Department officials added, regularly flies coach. Last Thursday, for instance, he flew on American Airlines to a fracking event in Washington County, Pennsylvania, in coach—the sort of commercial travel that is more typical, both said.

White House pool reports on February 7 described Trump arriving at 3:47 p.m. at Andrews and departing on Air Force One with Burgum on board shortly afterward. FlightAware, a company that tracks aviation movement, has no record of U.S. Park Police helicopters traveling in the Washington area on that day. But CopterSpotter, a website for the public to upload photos of helicopters they see in the Washington area, has a photograph of one of the Park Police helicopters flying near the Washington Monument at 3 p.m., shortly before Trump left the White House in his own helicopter.

Andrew Logan, an audio engineer who runs CopterSpotter and the website Helicopters of D.C., said that federal helicopters have the ability to turn off their outgoing GPS transponders, which might explain why FlightAware did not record the February 7 flight. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the Republican chair of the Commerce Committee, has been pushing federal aircraft in the D.C. region to more frequently display their transponder location after a January 29 crash between an Army helicopter not operating its transponder and a regional jet killed 67 people at Reagan National Airport.

Hanson, Burgum’s chief of staff, has told federal workers in Burgum’s office that the tradition of staff baking cookies began when he was governor of North Dakota, according to two people. She has worked for Burgum for decades, starting at his former company, Great Plains Software, before moving up to become a senior adviser to his gubernatorial campaign and the chief administrative officer for the state of North Dakota, according to her LinkedIn profile.

Burgum has also used the political appointees in his department for another purpose in recent days: stacking firewood in his office’s fireplace. At times, he has instructed his staff on the finer points of arranging logs so they won’t collapse and create noise when burning during meetings. An Interior Department official said many people in the department—from Burgum himself to the most junior staff—have helped make fires, and that if Burgum ever offered tips, it was not intended imperiously. Burgum, who worked as a chimney sweep in college, was likely just trying to be helpful, the official said.

Burgum has made some other peculiar requests of his staff. One standing request, described by two people, is that the labels get removed from water bottles before they are delivered to him. An Interior Department official said they remove the labels to avoid branding issues, especially when sharing photos on social media.

Not everyone who has worked for Burgum is concerned about the way he treats his staff. When an adviser close to Burgum over the past several years became aware of this story on Saturday evening, he proactively called us to say that, in the many hours he’s spent with Burgum, he has never seen him behave in an arrogant way. Burgum, this person told us, always carries his own bag and often replaces I in speeches with we in order to emphasize his team.

He so frequently begins meetings by expressing his gratitude for his staff or other people in the room that it’s become a running joke among his aides.

Burgum, this adviser said, is “the ultimate team guy who has a history of promoting young people,” dating back to his time at Great Plains Software.

# A Hilarious Movie That Understands the South


作者:  | 发布时间: April 6, 2025


Culture and entertainment musts from Annie Joy Williams

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily’s Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what’s keeping them entertained. Today’s special guest is Annie Joy Williams, an assistant editor who has written about the end of Hooters and the Republican leaders who once thought January 6 was “tragic.”

Annie Joy enjoys listening to Michael Martin Murphey with her father, recommends watching Vengeance for some proper honey-butter-chicken-biscuit appreciation, and is a proud Alex Cooper apologist.

But first, here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:

- Trump’s tariffs are designed to backfire.
- The curse of Ayn Rand’s heir
- Ashley Parker on miscarriage and motherhood

The Culture Survey: Annie Joy Williams

A musical artist who means a lot to me: Michael Martin Murphey. I have to thank my father for introducing me to him. My father was a pilot, so he was constantly traveling when I was growing up outside of Nashville. When he was in town, it was a special treat for me and my sisters to get picked up in his GMC truck, which was equipped with crank windows and decorated with enough bumper stickers to cause some serious fights with my mom.

There was always a Michael Martin Murphey tape in the cassette player. His song “Wildfire” brought my dad to tears. My personal favorites were “Vanishing Breed” and “Children of the Wild World.” When he played “Pilgrims on the Way,” my dad would slap his Wrangler jeans in time with the lyric “The cowboy slaps the dust away.” Some combination of hay, dirt, and dust would fly into the air (he moonlighted as a farmer), and I thought it was hilarious. He and I went on a trip to Montana this past winter, and Murphey was once again our soundtrack, for the first time in about 15 years. We both cried as we looked out the window.

My favorite movies: La La Land, Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, and (500) Days of Summer are all top films for me. A less widely known film that I just adore is B. J. Novak’s Vengeance. I find that many films about the South are offensive to those of us who hail from there. And I get it, it’s easy to make southerners the butt of the joke—we really tee it up for people sometimes. Rarely do I find a film that adequately captures both the good and the bad of a place so storied and complex. Novak spent substantial time in West Texas before filming to better understand its people. “I want this to be Texans’ favorite movie,” he told Texas Monthly.

The film is hilarious. I saw it in D.C. with a group of friends I once lived with in Texas, and we kept saying how its portrayal of the North-South disconnect is spot-on. Plus, it pays proper homage to the honey-butter chicken biscuit, which I appreciate. [Related: The podcast spreading the love of cowboy culture]

The last museum or gallery show that I loved: The Alvin Ailey exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American Art, in New York City. As a dance teacher, I’ve always admired the contributions Ailey made to modern dance. He was a gay Black man from rural Texas who used choreography as a form of protest during the civil-rights movement. He eventually became a household name in New York, showcasing routines inspired by the river baptisms and gospel music of his Texas childhood. My favorite part of the exhibit was the collection of notes he wrote to himself, a mix of manifestos and eight-count choreography. I visited the exhibit with my mother, who sacrificed a lot to put me through dance classes and endless competitions, so experiencing that together was sweet.

A quiet song that I love, and a loud song that I love: I’m more of a quiet-song person myself, so I’ll give you three: “Boyhood,” by the Japanese House; “Bathroom Light,” by Mt. Joy; and “Into the Mystic,” by Van Morrison.

A loud song that I love is “Love It if We Made It,” by the 1975. Also, “Yoü and I,” by Lady Gaga. Makes me wish I was from Nebraska.

A cultural product I loved as a teenager and still love, and something I loved but now dislike: It wasn’t so much a cultural product as it was a cultural moment, but I’d like to think I grew up in the era of peak Disney Channel. My sisters are firmly Millennials, so I got to bear witness to the greats of their generation, such as Lizzie McGuire and Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, as well as those of my generation—Hannah Montana, The Cheetah Girls, and, perhaps most notably, Disney Channel Games. I might have been too cool to love this stuff by my teenage years, but I’ve recently returned to these classics. My best friend and I discovered a Disney Channel Original Hits dance class at a studio in Brooklyn. We’ve gotten really close with the instructor, and it’s quickly become the highlight of our week. Now, the concealer lips, ultra-thin eyebrows, and extreme side parts from that era? We can leave those in 2005. [Related: What tween TV teaches kids]

A favorite story I’ve read in The Atlantic: “Jenisha From Kentucky,” by Jenisha Watts, and “The Day I Got Old,” by Caitlin Flanagan.

An online creator whom I’m a fan of: Look, say what you will, but Alex Cooper is a mastermind. I used to be a skeptic. The first time I listened to Call Her Daddy, I was stunned. It was 2019, and she was still tag-teaming the podcast with Sofia Franklyn. The episode was truly one of the most vulgar things I’d ever heard. Now I know she was scheming from the start. Cooper grabbed the world’s attention through her sex-forward crassness, and right when the public was ready to cast her out as a buxom blonde with little more to her than sex tricks and a pretty face, she showed her smarts. In the new, sans-Franklyn version of her show, she often gets rare sit-downs with pop-culture phenomenons, political candidates, and renowned actors. And they actually share revealing things with her because they’re thinking: This girl was just detailing her sex life in front of the whole world—she can’t judge me. Her unconventional openness invites openness from anyone sitting across from her. Not every interview is groundbreaking, but at least she’s getting every interview. Is her approach my style? Maybe not, but I’m a proud Alex Cooper apologist.

A poem that I return to: I’d like to think that I’m above bias here, but my sister is a poet, and I have spent my life trying to be half the writer she is. I always come back to this one poem she wrote about our experience as girls in church. Now we watch our nieces grow up and discover God.

God was not a girl. The earth he made with apples seeds, the heavens with half-priced glitter.

We danced, and God smiled.

Drop the crayon,                                         take a tampon.

Sundays are for silver crosses and I’m sorry, prayer groups circling

rumors. God is purity vow and camp deposit. God is a one-piece swimsuit.

God is not a girl. Our hips he made with hunger, our tongues with minty silence.

We kneel, and God tells us to smile.

## What a Microscopic Creature Taught Me About Parenting

# What a Microscopic Creature Taught Me About Parenting


作者:  | 发布时间: April 6, 2025


A single-celled organism helped shift my perspective on climate change—and on my child’s future.

One evening earlier this year, I came downstairs after putting our 4-year-old daughter to bed to find my husband looking at a series of maps of the United States, each showing possible futures given different climate-change projections. In one, my home states of Oklahoma and Nebraska succumb to intense heat; growing crops gets harder. In another, wildfires seem to consume the West. In the Northeast, sea levels rise. Everywhere, average temperatures skyrocket. In Vermont, where I now live, the maps imply that we will still have precious rainfall—and that catastrophic floods will continue.

“Want to watch Netflix?” I said.

It’s not that I don’t care about these predictions of doom. But I admit that my initial response—as the United States has (again) moved to exit the Paris climate agreement, as the protections of the Endangered Species Act are threatened, as the way is cleared for drilling in the Arctic—is to succumb to the temptation of apathy. It’s all too much, I think. I find myself bewildered over how best to respond to these crises—and how to reconcile our daughter, peacefully asleep upstairs, with a burning world that is widely expected to keep burning.

My day-to-day parenting to-do list often goes something like: clean up endlessly after an enthusiastic tornado of a child; work toward a condition that, sometimes, resembles financial security; raise my child to be a decent adult; brace myself for the overwhelm that comes with the pressure I feel to help save a planet in the grips of the sixth extinction.

In my climate-related dread, I know I’m not alone—even though the surgeon general’s report last year about the extreme anxiety coloring the experience of growing numbers of U.S. parents doesn’t mention climate change in the list of concerns causing rampant stress, guilt, and shame among caregivers. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are worried about climate change and feel a personal responsibility to do something about it. Yet when I speak with my climate-conscious friends, family, and fellow mothers, everyone seems to be straining to find agency and purpose.

Read: The concession to climate change I will not make

Raising young children tethers people firmly to the now—to a sometimes joyful, sometimes harrowing, often mundane and narrow world. (As Bluey’s dad laments while carrying a laundry basket in one episode of the eponymous TV show: “This never ends!”) But global climate change tugs many parents’ attention and energy outward—to frightening events and uncertain futures, both of which can feel paralyzing.

I can read scientific papers and the latest United Nations climate reports; I can watch Los Angeles burn. But how do I understand what I’m supposed to do, with my hands?

Lately, to answer that question, I’ve been turning to tiny worlds for help.

I received a microscope for Christmas, and I’ve been disappearing into the preset slides it came with: onion skin (staggered oblong blocks with a dark dot, a nucleus, held in each); a smear of human blood (thousands of scattered discs); a splice of rabbit spinal cord (a spongy oval, misshapen beads around its perimeter). Here, among these orderly universes mere millimeters wide, I find I can breathe.

My husband gave me the microscope, aware of my growing obsession with the small—an interest sparked by my introduction to foraminifera (forams for short), single-celled organisms of an ancient order of protist, which number in the thousands of species. These organisms have inhabited marine ecosystems for more than 540 million years, surviving numerous mass-extinction events.

I first learned about forams when I was researching sea-level rise in Maine’s salt marshes. Forams inhabit almost all marine environments, from deepest water to shore. Perhaps the first record of them in the human canon dates to the fifth century B.C.E., in Herodotus’s Histories, when he makes note of shell-like fossils embedded in the limestone blocks of the Egyptian pyramids.

As their longevity indicates, forams are incredibly adaptable and resilient. They build their shells, called “tests,” around themselves, some by collecting minerals from the surrounding waters and cementing them together. The shelters, most of them between half a millimeter and one millimeter long, are single- or multichambered, and shaped like a tube or a sphere, a spiral or a whorl. If you search for an image of a foram, you might see one that looks like a rudimentary shell with a series of ethereal lines shining around it like the sun’s corona. These are pseudopodia, or rhizopodia (rhizo meaning “root”), and are made up of cytoplasm; forams extend and retract these cytoplasmic threads as needed for moving, feeding, and constructing their shells.

Do I digress?

For me, forams were not a digression, but a revelation. Because, listen: Many species of foram are highly site-specific; they evolved within a narrow set of conditions, such as the temperature and oxygen content of the water and the mineral makeup of the surrounding sediments. These site conditions are not preferences but nonnegotiable bounds of survival. The more closely I looked at forams, the more I realized that they might have lessons to impart to humans about our physical place in a changing world.

Vann R. Newkirk II: What America owes the planet

The forams’ shells keep the fossil record. When the cell dies, the shell remains. The shape and structural content of these shells, as determined by their immediate surroundings, gives precise information about the environments that they exist in today, or that existed millennia ago. Their fossils are snapshots: miniature witnessings of a particular place and moment of transformation. It is thanks to this place-bound existence that forams have contributed to our understanding of massive, global change over eons.

Foram-fossil-informed discoveries include: changes in sea levels during the Carboniferous period (more than 300 million years ago), fluctuations in the oxygen content of the oceans during the Jurassic (roughly 201 million to 145 million years ago), and glacial activity during the Quaternary (beginning about 2.5 million years ago). The fossils tell us about present-day conditions as well. On a slide under a microscope, scientists can read the work of those tiny cytoplasmic arms. Perhaps a shell has been partly dissolved by acid in an industrial waterway, or is deformed by an encounter with pollutants. As Pratul Kumar Saraswati, an earth sciences professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai, wrote: “Foraminifera is both the clock and the recorder of the Earth’s history. It has played a crucial role in developing our understanding of the evolution of life and the environment on Earth.”

Pulling myself back to the human-scale world, I lift my eyes and look out the window with a new clarity. I think of the river down the street that flooded about a decade ago; the summers of record-breaking heat; the shifting composition of birdsong in the trees; the human community, in all its messy complexity. From this site-specific view, I don’t long for escape. Foraminifera have helped me remember that I, too, am tiny and fleeting. The conditions of my physical existence are narrow. This river valley defines my visible horizon. I breathe oxygen made by these trees. And with that remembrance, I feel a wave of relief. This is a world I can touch—a scope I can manage.

Read: A plan to cool off the hottest neighborhoods

The benefits of local, place-based conservation and environmental work are well documented. The restorative power of maintaining a close relationship to nature is demonstrated as well: Forest bathing, for one—from the Japanese practice of shinrin-yoku, in which mindful, sensory immersion in forests is a therapeutic exercise—has been shown to reduce stress and alleviate symptoms of depression.

But I suppose what I’ve been seeking goes beyond even this. Like the foraminifera building their shells, I want to construct something for myself and my family. As the scientist and author Robin Wall Kimmerer, an enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, writes in Braiding Sweetgrass:

Being naturalized to place means to live as if this is the land that feeds you, as if these are the streams from which you drink, that build your body and fill your spirit. To become naturalized is to know that your ancestors lie in this ground. Here you will give your gifts and meet your responsibilities. To become naturalized is to live as if your children’s future matters, to take care of the land as if our lives and the lives of all our relatives depend on it. Because they do.

Being naturalized to place means to live as if this is the land that feeds you, as if these are the streams from which you drink, that build your body and fill your spirit. To become naturalized is to know that your ancestors lie in this ground. Here you will give your gifts and meet your responsibilities. To become naturalized is to live as if your children’s future matters, to take care of the land as if our lives and the lives of all our relatives depend on it. Because they do.

The very small reminds me that I exist within limits, within constraints, within particular environments and communities and moments in time. From this narrow space, I can find expanded agency with which to act, and with which to parent.

So this past winter, I paid attention to the northern cardinal that sang at dawn. I began reading my daughter her first chapter books. I also began the process of getting my prescribed-fire certification, hoping to help with local ecosystem restoration. This spring, my daughter and I will pull invasive knotweed from our yard, and we’ll plant the wildflower seeds we collected late last summer. When the weather turns warmer, I’ll take her to swim in the river. Through these acts, I can construct the foundation of a worldview. I can extend my arms to what I can touch and taste. I can practice building a structure, a house—a home—where caring for my daughter and caring for the planet are not two separate things.

## Why Is Trump Mad at the Zoo?

# Why Is Trump Mad at the Zoo?


作者:  | 发布时间: April 6, 2025


In search of “improper ideology” among the animals

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

The order came down late in the evening, when the orangutans, lions, and crocodiles would be resting. The next morning, March 28, the animals awoke to a new political reality: The world’s most powerful man had taken an acute interest in their place of lodging, the National Zoo. President Donald Trump had directed Vice President J. D. Vance to rid the Smithsonian Institution of all “improper ideology.” As a ward of the Smithsonian, the zoo was not only covered by this mandate; it was specifically mentioned as one of the facilities to be cleansed of wrongthink.

Trump’s order leaves little mystery about what he wants changed at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History and its National Museum of African American History and Culture. It calls for the removal of “divisive,” “race-centered ideology” from those museums, and says that their exhibits should instead instill pride “in the hearts of all Americans.” But the order’s text is silent on the nature of the zoo’s ideological transgressions, and my email to the White House asking what they might be went unanswered. Trump has not previously been counted among the zoo’s critics, who tend to lament the life of captivity suffered by its animals, not their potential indoctrination.

I reached out to the zoo staff to ask if they knew what the administration wanted changed. When I did not immediately hear back, I decided to visit the zoo, in the mindset of a freshly appointed cultural commissar. One morning this week, I arrived at its Connecticut Avenue entrance. Pollen-coated cars were lined up outside, and blossoms on the zoo’s magnolias were turning themselves inside out in the clear morning sun. Just a few hundred yards down its central path, near the Asia Trail, a food truck was already serving cocktails.

From the July 1919 issue: Pessimism and the zoo

On my way over to the zoo, I’d read the institution’s most recent strategic plan. In the introduction, former National Zoo Director Steven Monfort says that by going from a global population of 1 billion to 8 billion in only 200 years, “humans have made things very hard for wildlife.” It occurred to me that Vance might find this characterization a touch too Malthusian; he has often railed against what he perceives as anti-natalism in liberal culture. But the sight of parents carrying Moscow mules and margaritas away from the food truck suggested family-friendliness, at least of a certain kind.

At the zoo’s newly renovated Bird House, I joined a long line of families clustered around strollers, waiting to be let into the aviaries. In 2023, I’d met the zoo’s chief curator for birds, Sara Hallager, while reporting a story about the institution’s decision to euthanize a fox that may have killed 25 of its flamingos. Hallager had told me that after the renovation, the zoo would no longer acquire birds from Africa, Asia, or South America. Its new exhibits would showcase only North American birds. Now I wondered: With this “America First” approach, had the zoo intended to obey (way) in advance? If so, that might explain why an enormous pink-marble sculpture of an eagle—salvaged from the original Penn Station—had been placed near the Bird House entrance.

As I moved deeper into the exhibit, this theory seemed less plausible. Its interpretive panels were not overtly political—I searched high and low for land acknowledgments and found none—but they also didn’t seem to have been designed to please Trump. For one thing, they’re printed in English and Spanish, a first for the zoo. They also celebrate the ability of migrating birds to move freely among the Amazon rainforest, North America, and the High Arctic.

I did find one potentially “divisive” panel in the turkey enclosure. It drew a distinction between North America’s Indigenous people, who hunted turkeys for thousands of years but took care not to wipe them out, and European colonists, who in just two centuries drove the birds to the brink of extinction. This may not be the sort of sentiment that “instills pride in the heart” of Americans. And yet it’s true.

Read: The aftermath of a mass slaughter at the zoo

Everywhere I went, I heard kids buzzing about the zoo’s new star attractions, two pandas named Bao Li and Qing Bao that Xi Jinping had sent from China as a gesture of friendship. A source at the Smithsonian Institution who was not authorized to speak to the press told me that before the pandas went on public view, the zoo had been besieged with messages from senators requesting advance meet and greets. I briefly entertained the thought that the zoo had ended up in Trump’s crosshairs because some key ally of his had been denied a picture with the bears. Whatever the case, Bao Li himself seemed entirely indifferent to politics. He sat, lolled back against a green hillside, chewing through whole sticks of bamboo like they were Twizzlers at the movies.

The zoo features less explicit climate advocacy than you might expect from an institution devoted to animal conservation. Most of it is concentrated in a single room in the Amazonia building. The Trump administration has been relentless about scrubbing government websites of all mentions of climate change, no matter how anodyne, but this was gentle stuff. In the center of a large mural from the 1990s recommending solar power, a kid wearing baggy clothes—now back in fashion—picks up trash in a forest. No fossil-fuel multinationals are named and shamed in the surrounding panels. The staff members in green vests did not appear to be indoctrinating anyone. They just gamely answered questions about the neon-blue tree frogs in a nearby terrarium.

The exit from Amazonia dumped me out onto a path that runs along the zoo’s southern edge. Traffic noise wafted down from the Duke Ellington Bridge, reminding me that I was not in a rainforest, but in the middle of Washington, D.C.—a city that Trump has derided as a “filthy and crime-ridden embarrassment to our nation.” Continuing down the path, I arrived at the Kids’ Farm exhibit, a shining scene of rural Americana that would not have been out of place on a butter label. Near the big red barn and stables, toddlers were perched on a fence, petting mules. A cow’s blotchy black coat shimmered in the bright heat of the afternoon. Like the Bootheel BBQ & Southern Catering food truck parked nearby, which promised to “feed your Southern soul,” the exhibit seemed designed to flatter, not antagonize, a narrow and nostalgic view of “real America.”

Before leaving the zoo, I popped into the visitor’s center. I confirmed that the bookstore inside was aimed at the nonpartisan animal lover, not the activist, and learned that the zoo usually holds a secular-coded celebration of Easter—its focus is nature’s post-winter bounty, not the newly risen Christ. The zoo’s website calendar does show that last year, and for several years prior, it also recognized International Family Equality Day. Local LGTBQ organizations participated in the event, and some described it as “Gay Day at the Zoo.” As part of the festivities, guests were able to watch a beaver or seal eat rainbow-dyed ice cake. Last year’s event also had a musical performance featuring themes of “climate justice, inclusion, queer identity, and community.” When I emailed the zoo to ask whether International Family Equality Day would continue this year, I did not receive a reply.

I could see how this celebration might inflame a social conservative, but the tame, one-day event did not seem like enough to merit the zoo’s inclusion in the executive order. Nor did any of the other things that I’d found—unless the administration is taking a “broken windows” approach to policing ideology.

Then again, I can’t claim that my audit was exhaustive. I had intended to visit every exhibit, but I ended up skipping the Reptile House. Not for lack of interest; it’s actually one of my favorite places at the zoo—the pythons and unblinking crocodiles provide a real encounter with the animal other. But the line was very long, with little shade. And so I can’t tell you for certain that the Reptile House isn’t a hotbed of critical race theory, or other MAGA heresies. Vance and his team will have to find out and let us know.

## What the Comfort Class Doesn’t Get

# What the Comfort Class Doesn’t Get

People with generational wealth control a society that they don’t understand.

Recently, I accidentally overdrew my checking account. That hadn’t happened to me in years—the last time was in 2008, when I was running a small business with no safety net in the middle of a financial crisis. Back then, an overdrawn account meant eating canned soup and borrowing cash from friends only slightly better off than me. This time, I didn’t need to worry—I was able to move money from a different account. And yet all the old feelings—heart palpitations, the seizure of reason in my brain—came right back again.

I have one of those wearable devices that monitors my heart rate, sleep quality, activity level, and calories burned. Mine is called an Oura ring, and at the end of the day, it told me what I already knew: I had been “unusually stressed.” When this happens, the device asks you to log the source of your stress. I scrolled through the wide array of options—diarrhea, difficulty concentrating, erectile dysfunction, emergency contraceptives. I could not find “financial issues,” or anything remotely related to money, listed.

According to a poll from the American Psychiatric Association, financial issues are the No. 1 cause of anxiety for Americans: 58 percent say they are very or somewhat anxious about money. How, I wondered, was it possible that this had not occurred to a single engineer at Oura?

For all of the racial, gender, and sexual reckonings that America has undergone over the past decade, we have yet to confront the persistent blindness and stigma around class. When people struggle to understand the backlash against elite universities, or the Democrats’ loss of working-class voters, or the fact that more and more Americans are turning away from mainstream media, this is why.

America is not just suffering from a wealth gap; America has the equivalent of a class apartheid. Our systems—of education, credentialing, hiring, housing, and electing officials—are dominated and managed by members of a “comfort class.” These are people who were born into lives of financial stability. They graduate from college with little to no debt, which enables them to advance in influential but relatively low-wage fields—academia, media, government, or policy work. Many of them rarely interact or engage in a meaningful way with people living in different socioeconomic strata than their own. And their disconnect from the lives of the majority has expanded to such a chasm that their perspective—and authority—may no longer be relevant.

Take, for instance, those lawmakers desperately workshopping messages to working-class folks: More than half of congressional representatives are millionaires. In academia, universities are steered by college presidents—many of whom are paid millions of dollars a year—and governed by boards of trustees made up largely of multimillionaires, corporate CEOs, and multimillionaire corporate CEOs. (I know because I serve on one of these boards.) Once, a working-class college dropout like Jimmy Breslin could stumble into a newsroom and go on to win the Pulitzer Prize; today, there’s a vanishingly small chance he’d make it past security. A 2018 survey of elite newsrooms found that 65 percent of summer interns had attended top-tier colleges.

College attainment is more than a matter of educational status; it is also a marker of class comfort. Seventy percent of people who have at least one parent with a bachelor’s degree also have a bachelor’s degree themselves. These graduates out-earn and hold more wealth than their first-generation college peers. At elite schools, about one in seven students comes from a family in the top 1 percent of earners. Graduates of elite colleges comprise the majority of what a study in Nature labeled “extraordinary achievers”: elected officials, Fortune 500 CEOs, Forbes’s “most powerful,” and best-selling authors.

What we have is a compounded problem, in which people with generational wealth pull the levers on a society that they don’t understand. Whether corporate policies or social welfare or college financial aid, nearly every aspect of society has been designed by people unfamiliar with not only the experience of living in poverty but the experience of living paycheck to paycheck—a circumstance that, Bank of America data shows, a quarter of Americans know well.

The dissonance between the way the powerful think and how the rest of America lives is creating a lot of chaos. It can be seen in the rejection of DEI and “woke-ism”—which is about racism, yes, but also about the imposition of the social mores of an elite class. It can be seen above all in the rise of Donald Trump, who won again in part because he—unlike Democrats—didn’t dismiss the “vibecession” but exploited it by addressing what people were feeling: stressed about the price of eggs.

These phenomena might not be rational. But anxiety isn’t rational. Studies have found that working through a challenging financial time can affect one’s brain as much as missing an entire night’s sleep, or a loss of 13 IQ points. Financial anxiety is linked with higher rates of depression and psychological distress, which can manifest in physical health issues such as heart disease and reduced immune response. The feeling of scarcity can also affect people’s ability to make sound decisions and retain information—not helpful when you can’t afford the late fee on a bill. In short, the haves are literally in a different head space than the have-nots.

Exacerbating this problem is widespread class dysmorphia. One reason so many well-off Americans feel capable of opining about less well-off Americans is because they don’t realize that they are, in fact, well-off in the first place. The explosion of the American billionaire class—from 272 individuals in 2001 to 813 in 2024, according to Forbes—has made millionaires feel relatively poor. There are more of them too. The number of Americans worth $30 million or more grew by 7.5 percent in 2023 alone. And still, according to a survey of millionaires done that year, two-thirds of them did not consider themselves wealthy.

Here’s the broader situation: 30 percent of American households are classified by Pew as low income, and 19 percent are upper income. And yet a 2024 Gallup survey found that only 12 percent of Americans identified themselves as “lower class” and just 2 percent as “upper class.” In short: No one wants to be perceived as poor, and no one rich ever feels rich enough.

As a result, the very term middle class has become a meaningless catchall for a disparate range of lived financial experiences. No wonder so much policy and rhetoric geared toward this group fails to stick. Who are these policies actually for? And what theoretical problems do they aim to address? Those of the third-generation college-educated social worker, whose parents helped her with a down payment on a house? Or those of the first-gen woman with student loans who holds the same job and lives in a rental apartment? Technically they earn the same wage and both likely see themselves as middle class, but they have extremely different lives because only one is a member of the comfort class.

Members of the comfort class are not necessarily wealthy. Perhaps one day they will earn or inherit sums that will put them in that category. But wealth is not the marker of the comfort class. Security is. An emergency expense—say a $1,200 medical bill—would send most Americans into a fiscal tailspin; for the comfort class, a text to Mom and Dad can render “emergencies” nonexistent.

This helps explain why the comfort class tends to vote differently. Someone who feels they don’t fundamentally need to worry about money if things go south will be more willing to vote on their values—issues like democratic norms or reproductive rights—than someone whose week-to-week concern is how inflation affects her grocery budget.

Many things drove voters to Trump, including xenophobia, transphobia, and racism. But the feeling that the Democratic Party had been hijacked by the comfort class was one of them. I recently saw—and admittedly laughed at—a meme showing a group of women from The Handmaid’s Tale. The text read: “I know, I know, but I thought he would bring down the price of eggs.”

To many Americans, classism is the last socially acceptable prejudice. It’s not hard to understand the resentment of a working-class person who sees Democrats as careful to use the right pronouns and acknowledge that we live on stolen Indigenous land while happily mocking people for worrying about putting food on the table.

Even when Americans of different classes are in close proximity, they tend to talk past one another. I still remember, my freshman year of college, coming back to my dorm to discover that my roommate had eaten the leftovers I’d saved from dinner the night before. I flew into a rage, and she had no idea why. She came from a household where leftovers were disposable. From her perspective, all she’d done was have a harmless drunken snack. From my perspective, she’d eaten my next meal, and I couldn’t afford another one.

I move in circles now where everyone’s zip code and alma mater alludes to a homogeneity of experience, but when I start discussing policy or politics with people—be they on the left or the right—I often feel that invisible gap yawn between us.

Just the other day, in honor of Indie Bookstore Day, I was asked to share a childhood memory of an independent bookstore. But I did not have a childhood memory of an independent bookstore. I grew up going to the library because there was no bookstore—independent or otherwise—in my blue-collar Brooklyn neighborhood. I didn’t go to a bookstore until I was a teenager, roaming Manhattan with my friends. For a moment, I felt embarrassed. But then I remembered how much unexamined presumption was behind the question. Most authors come from the comfort class, raised in homes full of books in quaint neighborhoods with local bookstores.

That’s a harmless example. But in the past eight weeks, life for working-class Americans has deteriorated in real ways. Millions of senior citizens are nail-biting about their Social Security benefits. People are worried for their jobs. The costs of eggs, orange juice, and utilities are on the rise. Mortgages and medical bills need to be paid. Rents will be due. Blood pressures will spike; judgments will be clouded; debts will no doubt be incurred. And the pundits and politicians, on all sides, will watch it from a safe, comfortable distance.

# The Cardboard-Carrying Opposition Arrives

The “Hands Off” protest in Washington, D.C., drew thousands of people with a lot of feelings—but as-yet-inchoate anger at the Trump administration.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

The opposition arrived in a flurry of painted cardboard.

Until this week, the 11th of Donald Trump’s second presidency, the resistance has not exactly been uppercase R. Any show of dissent by Democratic leadership has been virtually nonexistent, and protests against Trump’s policies have been small and sporadic. Citizen frustration with the new administration has registered nationally as little more than a distant rumble.

Today’s “Hands Off” protest, organized by a coalition of left-wing groups, was an attempt to raise the volume.

People carted their megaphones and rainbow flags to more than 1,200 sites across the country today—in D.C., of course, but also in Helena, Montana; Daytona Beach, Florida; and Dubuque, Iowa. The events spanned all 50 states, the organizers said, plus a few more exotic locales, such as Guadalajara, Lisbon, and Paris. Washington had expected to draw about 10,000 protesters; in the end, several times that showed up.

In interviews with some of those gathered today on the National Mall, demonstrators told me that they were under no illusion that Trump or Elon Musk would be much swayed by their anger or creative signage. The point, they said, was to show the rest of America that the opposition exists—and is widespread. “This is not for them,” Gina King, a retired teacher from New York City, told me. “This is for us.”

The first mass protest of this administration was well timed. The week began with Cory Booker’s record-breaking 25-hour tirade against Trump from the Senate floor. The monologue accomplished nothing tangible—though it threw Booker’s Oura-ring readings out of whack—but it was a welcome stunt for voters who have been craving louder public rage against the administration’s actions. (What says outrage more than a man willing to hold it for 25 hours?) Then, on Tuesday night, Democrats in Wisconsin won the first electoral test of Trump’s second presidency, by defeating a state-supreme-court candidate backed by Trump and $20 million from Musk. Also on Tuesday, one of the largest mass layoffs of federal workers to date began, when employees at the CDC and the FDA were dismissed. Finally, on Thursday, Trump’s tariffs sent Americans’ retirement savings plunging, triggered manufacturer layoffs, and forced CNBC to bring its bear-market graphic out of hibernation.

King, the retired teacher, carried a sign thanking Booker and Wisconsinites for their efforts in the fight against Trump. She protested the president during the Women’s March in early 2017, but this political moment is different, she told me. “It feels more desperate,” she said. “We should all be standing in front of the Supreme Court every day, in front of the National Institutes of Health every day.”

Half a dozen federal employees spoke with me at the protest, but none wanted to share their full name for fear of retribution from the Trump administration. “I’m here because I feel powerless,” said a man named Edward, who had just been forced out of his longtime government job. He carried a sign mocking the “five bullet points” that federal employees are now required to submit weekly to Musk’s DOGE.

“In the original Women’s March, we were very concerned with women’s rights, but now he’s touching all areas,” Tracie, an employee in the Department of Veterans Affairs, told me. She was willing to risk her job to show up at the protest, together with her daughter and granddaughter, she told me, because she wants America to see her anger. “The administration is completely discounting us. They’re saying we’re bought, we’re paid for, we’re bused in.” But the opposition to Trump is real, she said. “We are out here.”

On the Mall, it was difficult to pinpoint a chief complaint or singular demand. Hands off what, exactly? I asked.

There were so many things to be furious about. No single piece of cardstock could contain it all. People carried posters about the administration’s deportation of immigrants and dissident students; Laura Loomer’s Oval Office influence; Musk’s taking a chain saw to the federal government; the return of preventable diseases; the technological ineptitude of Trump’s defense officials; and attacks on abortion rights.

Many of those I spoke with cited creeping fascism. “There’s been a total disregard of habeas corpus,” Larry Bostian, a retiree from Silver Spring, Maryland, told me. “Democracy is in a death spiral.” Paul Singleton, an Air Force veteran from Stafford, Virginia, agreed. “I used to wonder, how did Hitler do what he did?” he said. “When Trump got into office and started appointing all these people, I stopped.”

Given the stakes, people wanted to know, where was Democratic Party leadership? Katrin Hinrichsen, a retired computer engineer from Connecticut, had brought a few signage options, including one that read Time to CHUCK Schumer. “I want some effective leadership of the Democratic minority,” she told me.

A few Democratic lawmakers addressed the rally in D.C., including Representatives Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. They were speaking on a stage somewhere amid the dense crowd gathered at the base of the Washington Monument. But most people couldn’t hear them; some had no idea there was a stage at all. Instead, parts of the rally devolved into a kind of hippie picnic, where sign carriers chatted in circles or plopped on the grass to eat sandwiches. One woman handed out nuts and dried fruit: “Cashews, anyone?” Another laughed with her friends—“The last time I felt safe in a crowd this big was at a Taylor Swift concert!”

“We’ve been scattered; we’ve been demoralized,” Bostian, the retiree from Silver Spring, told me, looking at the sea of people around him. “But this is awesome.”

The 2017 Women’s March connected protesters who kept in touch, established “Resistance” groups in their hometowns, and eventually helped elect a wave of new Democrats during the 2018 midterms. Today’s protesters think that they can do it again. They just need the rest of America to hear them.

## My Snail Mucin Is Caught in a Trade War

# My Snail Mucin Is Caught in a Trade War


作者:  | 发布时间: April 5, 2025


Tariffs could upend America’s love affair with Korean skin care.

When Korean skin care arrived in the United States several years ago, it became the stuff of legend among beauty enthusiasts. They raved about the sunscreen from the Korean brand Beauty of Joseon, which used advanced UV filters and left no white film behind; currently, it costs $18—its closest American counterpart would be about $40 and gloopier. Korean snail mucin promised to hydrate skin and improve fine lines, and prompted a buying frenzy, during which I did drop my own American dollars on a facial “essence” made from the secretions of snails. It has made my skin softer and only grossed me out twice.

Now my snail mucin is caught in a trade war. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s announcement of nearly global tariffs included a 25 percent hike on goods imported to the U.S. from South Korea; his administration has also repealed a customs loophole used by certain K-beauty exporters based in Hong Kong. Some skin-care enthusiasts had been preparing for possible trade disruptions—“spent my paycheck on korean skincare because those tariffs are about to go crazy,” one person posted in December. But now, they’re springing into action. “If you love your glow, get it now,” one skin-care influencer said on TikTok. “This is your last chance before it becomes unaffordable.”

Americans’ love affair with K-beauty was fostered by many years of free trade with South Korea, when our mucin came free of additional fees. The new tariffs will be “a good test to see how powerful the K brand is” in America, Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies U.S.–South Korea relations, told me—how much “soft power” Korea has accumulated here. If people have been buying K-beauty products because they love K-beauty (or K-pop or K-dramas), a price hike might not matter. But if they decide Korean products haven’t done that much for their skin, maybe they’ll switch to Neutrogena.

Beauty enthusiasts have, at times, gone to great lengths to import Korean serums, face masks, moisturizers, sunscreens, and the like from exporters usually based in Korea or Hong Kong. When Joshua Dupaya, a beauty influencer, first got into Korean products in 2016, for instance, he sourced them mostly from “trusted eBay sellers,” he told me. Cosmetics have become a fairly significant part of Korea’s exports—$10 billion globally last year, nearly $2 billion of which went to the United States. And certain K-beauty brands are more beloved here than in their home country. A co-founder of Beauty of Joseon said on a podcast in December, “We’re not really popular in Korea, I have to admit.” (Their Korean brand name means “beautiful woman in Joseon,” referring to the former, long-reigning Korean Joseon dynasty. She said Koreans think the name is “so tacky.”)

Part of K-beauty’s appeal is its price point—$15 for a high-quality moisturizing cream compares favorably with a $20 bottle of CeraVe, and extremely favorably with the $390 La Mer “crème” touted by the upper echelon of skin-care influencers and celebrities. Korean beauty products also contain ingredients that are uncommon in U.S. skin care, but that some American consumers swear by—Centella asiatica (Asiatic pennywort), rice water, ginseng extract, and of course, snail mucin. Their sunscreen is also just objectively better. The FDA is notoriously slow to approve new UV filters, which has meant that sunscreen in America is generally worse than it is in Europe and Asia. Formulations here feel chalkier and oilier, and they can leave white residue behind, because American chemists have a smaller palette of UV technology to draw from. For $12, someone could buy American sunscreen in uninspiring packaging that makes them look like a ghost. For the same $12, they could buy a K-beauty sunscreen in expensive-looking packaging that will not make them look like a ghost. When my friend returned from South Korea with an entire carry-on full of Korean skin care, we applied gobs of sunscreen, feeling like royalty with our advanced UV protection. For skin-care aficionados, K-beauty was an ideal trifecta: a product that feels luxurious, seems effective, and is relatively affordable.

Read: You’re not allowed to have the best sunscreens in the world

The tariffs will test whether a higher price outweighs those other benefits. Yesterday, the founder of the Korean company KraveBeauty announced on TikTok that the tariff will hit their next shipment to the U.S. and will have to be passed on to customers. “We’re still calculating what the implications of this new trade policy would be to our business, but this will change pretty much everything,” she said—for her company and others. She said the tariffs could upend her brand’s long-standing policy of keeping all their products under $28; those responding in the comments already spoke of K-beauty in the past tense; many included crying-face emoji.

Trump’s tariffs, of course, apply only to imported K-beauty. In the past several years, a handful of major K-beauty manufacturers have opened factories in the United States and will be able to avoid the tariffs, Yeo told me. But he expects that other Korea-based companies will wait about a year to see if these tariffs last and how U.S. consumers respond to the price hike before they consider relocating to America. “I don’t know if Koreans want to invest that much,” he said. “It depends how bullish you think the U.S. market is.” American demand for K-beauty has grown a lot, but brands will have to decide if they think it’ll keep growing. The U.S. isn’t their only market, and companies may choose to focus on countries such as China instead.

But if the tariff succeeds and more K-beauty is soon made in America, the industry could lose its major selling point: it is not made in America. These non-U.S. formulations are the “whole allure of using Korean beauty,” Dupaya told me. Beauty of Joseon recently began making versions of its beloved sunscreen specifically for the U.S. market, which meant it could use only UV technology approved by the FDA. Fairly or not, American users seem to think they have the same problems as U.S. sunblock. “Garbage,” a skin-care influencer said about one of the American formulations. “Absolute garbage.”

# Trump’s Preoccupation With Tariffs


作者:  | 发布时间: April 5, 2025


A dramatic shift in America’s trade policy has left economists warning of rising costs and the risk of a recession.

Donald Trump’s tariff announcement has baffled global leaders and forced markets to reckon with the fallout from America’s dramatic shift in international trade policy. Panelists joined on Washington Week With The Atlantic to discuss what tanking financial markets could mean for the president’s administration.

“Trade has not delivered the benefits that economists and politicians of both parties have been promising for decades,” David Leonhardt explained last night. While the United States economy has tended to work in favor of educated professionals, blue-collar workers have not benefited in the same ways. Adjustments to trade policy could be one way to address this, but Trump’s tariffs are “shambolic, they’re extremely high,” and “no one knows whether he’s going to take them back the next day,” Leonhardt continued.

Joining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, to discuss this and more: Stephen Hayes, editor of The Dispatch; David Leonhardt, an editorial director for The New York Times editorial board; Kayla Tausche, a senior White House correspondent at CNN; Nancy Youssef, a national-security correspondent for The Wall Street Journal.

## Take Trump Seriously About Greenland

# Take Trump Seriously About Greenland


作者:  | 发布时间: April 5, 2025


The Danes seem to believe him, and so should Americans.

The United States grabbing land from an ally sounds like the stuff of a Netflix political thriller. But every American should contemplate three realities about Donald Trump’s aggressive desire to acquire Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory. First, unlike his usual shtick, in which he floats wild ideas and then he and his aides alternate between saying he was serious and saying he might have been joking, he means it. The Danes seem to believe him, and so should Americans. When institutions begin planning based on the president’s directions, as the White House is now doing, it’s no longer idle talk.

Second, Trump is calling for actions that likely contravene American and international law. He is undermining the peace and stability of an allied nation, while threatening a campaign of territorial conquest. He refuses to rule out an unprovoked war of aggression, a violation of the United Nations Charter and an international crime that would be little different in kind from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attempt to seize Ukraine. Finally, the almost-certain illegality of any attempt to seize Greenland against the will of its people and the Danish government means that if Trump directs the U.S. military to engage in such an operation, he could well precipitate the greatest civil-military crisis in American history since the Civil War.

How do we know Trump is serious? “One way or another,” the president crowed in his speech to a Joint Session of Congress last month, “we’re gonna get it.” A few weeks later, in case anyone missed the point, Trump told NBC: “We’ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100 percent.” Trump says a lot of strange things, certainly. He has mused about striking hurricanes with nuclear weapons, running for a constitutionally prohibited third term, staying in office even if he loses, and annexing Canada as the 51st state. But when a president publicly makes a vow to Congress to do something and then repeats that vow over and over, such statements are not trial balloons; they are policy.

And sure enough, Trump has followed up by sending Vice President J. D. Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, as unwelcome emissaries to Greenland. Vance—a neo-isolationist who apparently expresses opposition to the president’s plans only in Signal chats—has now embraced Trump’s old-school imperialism. Worse, Vance tried to press Trump’s case by boorishly criticizing Denmark’s relationship with the island, smarmily telling the Danes: “You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.” (Imagine the reaction in Washington if a European leader came, say, to Puerto Rico, castigated America’s management of the commonwealth, and urged the island to sever ties with the United States.) But at least he promised that military force, which to gain Greenland would have to be directed against Denmark, a NATO ally, was not going to be part of America’s efforts.

Trump, true to form, short-sheeted his hapless VP the next day by saying that military force was not, in fact, “off the table.”

On Monday, The Washington Post reported that the White House has begun work on estimating the costs of controlling Greenland in “the most concrete effort yet to turn President Donald Trump’s desire to acquire the Danish territory into actionable policy.” Once these kinds of meetings start taking place in the White House, the next step is usually to send out orders to the rest of the American national-security establishment, including the CIA and the Pentagon, to begin planning for various contingencies.

Even if the American people supported direct aggression against our own allies—by a large margin, they do not—public opinion is not a legitimate excuse for treaty-breaking. Treaties are the law of the land in the United States, and the president’s Article II powers as commander in chief do not allow him to wave a monarchical hand and violate those treaties at will. Just as Trump cannot legally issue orders to violate the Geneva Conventions or other agreements to which the United States is a signatory, he does not have the right to break America’s pact with NATO at will and effectively declare war against Denmark. When George W. Bush ordered U.S. forces into combat against Iraq in 2003, some of his critics claimed that his actions were illegal, but Bush at least had the fig leaf of a congressional resolution, as well as a lengthy list of UN Security Council resolutions. Trump will have literally nothing except his insistent greed and glory-seeking vanity.

If the U.S. military is given direct orders to seize Greenland—that is, if it is told to enter the territory of another nation, pull down that nation’s flag, and then claim the ground in the name of the United States—it will have been ordered to attack an ally and engage in a war of conquest, even if no shot is ever fired. These would be illegal orders, because they would violate not only our treaty obligations but also international prohibitions against unprovoked wars of aggression. At home, the president would be contravening the Constitution: Article II does not allow the commander in chief to run around the planet seizing territories he happens to want.

At that point, every senior commander, from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs on down, has a moral obligation to refuse to accept or support such a command. Pauline Shanks Kaurin, a military-ethics professor at the Naval War College (where I also taught for many years) told me, speaking in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the Defense Department, that civilian leaders have “the right to be wrong,” but that if the United States moves against Greenland, especially if both America and Denmark are part of NATO, “senior military leaders have an obligation to advise against this course of action and resign if necessary.” Shanks Kaurin added that this obligation might even extend to a requirement to refuse to draw up any plans.

But what if the orders are less obvious? Trump long ago mastered the Mafia-like talent of making his desires evident without actually telling others to engage in unsavory acts. In that case, he could issue instructions to the military aimed at intimidating Greenland that on their face are legal but that are obviously aggressive.

Retired Major General Charles Dunlap, who served as the deputy judge advocate general of the U.S. Air Force and now teaches law at Duke, suggested that Trump could take advantage, for example, of the wide latitude given to the United States in its basing agreement with Greenland. The president, Dunlap told me in an email, could choose to engage in “a gross misreading of the agreement” and move a large number of troops to Greenland as “a show of force aimed at establishing a fait accompli of some kind.” Military officers are required to presume that commands from higher authority are legal orders, and so a series of directives aimed at swarming forces into Greenland would likely be obeyed, Dunlap said, “because of the potential ambiguity” of such directives “as well as the inference of lawfulness.”

In any case, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have taken important steps to ensure that no one is left in the Pentagon to tell them that their orders might be unlawful. All of the top military lawyers whose job is to provide independent legal advice on such matters have been fired. And, as Dunlap notes, courts are notoriously reluctant to get involved in such questions, which is why Congress must step in. “The military,” he said, “ought not be put in the middle of something like this.”

Americans used to take their presidents far more seriously. Before Trump, when a president spoke, his words instantly became the policy of the United States government—for better or worse. When President Ronald Reagan caught his own aides flat-footed by bungling a policy message during a press conference in 1983, for example, a Reagan-administration official later said: “You can’t say ‘No, he didn’t mean it’ or ‘That’s not really government policy.’ That’s out of the question.”

But those days are long gone. As a direct result of Trump’s many off-the-cuff ruminations and long stretches of political glossolalia, Trump has convinced many Americans not to take their president at his word until it’s too late. (Consider how many people, for example, refused to believe that he would impose massive global tariffs, a policy they can now examine more closely by the light of a burning stock market.)

I realize that this entire discussion seems like utter lunacy. War against … Denmark? But when the president says something, it’s policy. Trump insists that he must be taken seriously. Americans and their elected representatives across the political spectrum should oblige him.
